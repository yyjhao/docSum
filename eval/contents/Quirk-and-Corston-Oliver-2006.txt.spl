first , is a treelet smt system sensitive to parse quality ?
we have shown that such a system is sensitive to the quality of the input syntactic analyses .
with the less accurate parsers that result from training on extremely small numbers of sentences , performance is comparable to state-of-the-art phrasal smt systems .
as the amount of data used to train the parser increases , both english-to-german and english-tojapanese treelet smt improve , and produce results that are statistically significantly better than the phrasal baseline .
in the introduction we mentioned the concern that others have raised when we have presented our research : syntax might contain valuable information but current parsers might not be of sufficient quality .
it is certainly true that the accuracy of the best parser used here falls well short of what we might hope for .
a parser that achieves 90.8 % dependency accuracy when trained on the penn treebank wall street journal corpus and evaluated on comparable text degrades to 84.3 % accuracy when evaluated on technical text .
despite the degradation in parse accuracy caused by the dramatic differences between the wall street journal text and the technical articles , the treelet smt system was able to extract useful patterns .
research on syntactically-informed smt is not impeded by the accuracy of contemporary parsers .
one significant finding is that as few as 250 sentences suffice to train a dependency parser for use in the treelet smt framework .
to date our research has focused on translation from english to other languages .
one concern in applying the treelet smt framework to translation from languages other than english has been the expense of data annotation : would we require 40,000 sentences annotated for syntactic dependencies , i.e. , an amount comparable to the penn treebank , in order to train a parser that was sufficiently accurate to achieve the machine translation quality that we have seen when translating from english ?
the current study gives hope that source languages can be added with relatively modest investments in data annotation .
as more data is annotated with syntactic dependencies and more accurate parsers are trained , we would hope to see similar improvements in machine translation output .
we challenge others who are conducting research on syntactically-informed smt to verify whether or to what extent their systems are sensitive to parse quality .
