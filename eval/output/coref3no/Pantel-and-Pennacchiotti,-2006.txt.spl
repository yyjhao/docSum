below is a summary of the main contributions of this paper : algorithm for exploiting generic patterns : unlike previous algorithms that require significant manual work to make use of generic patterns , we propose an unsupervised web-filtering method for using generic patterns ; principled reliability measure : we propose a new measure of pattern and instance reliability which enables the use of generic patterns .
minimally supervised algorithms , like -LRB- hearst 1992 ; pantel et al. 2004 -RRB- , typically ignore generic patterns since system precision dramatically
other pattern-based algorithms include -LRB- riloff and shepherd 1997 -RRB- , who used a semi-automatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples , knowitall -LRB- etzioni et al. 2005 -RRB- that performs large-scale extraction of facts from the web , mann -LRB- 2002 -RRB- who used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of is-a relations involving proper nouns , and -LRB- downey et al. 2005 -RRB- who formalized the problem of relation extraction in a coherent and effective combinatorial model that is shown to outperform previous probabilistic frameworks .
for each output set , per relation , we evaluate the precision of the system by extracting a random sample of instances -LRB- 50 for the trec corpus and 20 for the chem corpus -RRB- and evaluating their quality manually using two human judges -LRB- a total of 680 instances were annotated per judge -RRB- .
