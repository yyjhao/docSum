compatible coordination arguments -LRB- c4 -RRB- for each conjunction token i and each set of tokens a in x with incompatible pos tags , we add a constraint to forbid configurations where i has the argument tokens a. for training we use single-best mira -LRB- mcdonald et al. , 2005a -RRB- .
we not only present our accuracy but also provide an empirical evaluation of the runtime behavior of this approach and show how parsing can be accelerated using a simple approximation .
to evaluate our systems we use the accuracy over labeled attachment decisions : table 1 shows our results using nine-fold cross - validation on the cross set .
while we expect a longer runtime than using the chu-liu-edmonds as in previous work -LRB- mcdonald et al. , 2005b -RRB- , we are interested in how large the increase is .
for example , during our runtime evaluations we find that a large fraction of solve time is spent in the first iteration
however , their model suffers from the same type of exponential blow-up we observe when we add all our cycle constraints in advance .
this allows us to efficiently use ilp for dependency parsing and add constraints which provide a significant improvement over the current state - of-the-art parser -LRB- mcdonald et al. , 2005b -RRB- on the dutch alpino corpus -LRB- see bl row in table 1 -RRB- .
