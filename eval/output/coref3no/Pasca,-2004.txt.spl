in this paper , we present a lightweight , lightly-supervised method for acquiring named entities in arbitrary categories from web documents .
the extraction is a three-step process consisting of document pre-processing , extraction of categorical facts , and derivation of categories .
the fact and associated instance name are captured with a set of patterns which can be summarized as : the matching of the patterns in the sentences results in pairs -LRB- x , n -RRB- of categorical facts and instance names , which are underlined the sample sentence that is because software firewalls , including zone alarm , offer some semblance of this feature .
one of the following situations may occur as illustrated in table 1 : 1 -RRB- no plural-form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 2 -RRB- a plural - form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact , but it is immediately -LRB- e.g. , within 5 tokens -RRB- preceded by another plural-form noun phrase ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 3 -RRB- otherwise , the noun phrase is retained as the lexicalized category of the instance name n. note that one of the categories selected in table 1 is programming languages rather than other programming languages .
a direction to explore further is the recovery followed by discovery of relations among
