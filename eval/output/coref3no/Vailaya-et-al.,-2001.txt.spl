our experiments revealed a total of 11 semantic categories : forests and farmlands , mountains , beach scenes , pathways , sunset \/ sunrise images , long distance city shots , streets \/ buildings , monuments \/ towers , shots of washington , dc
experiments were conducted on two databases -LRB- both independently and combined -RRB- of 5081 -LRB- indoor \/ outdoor classification -RRB- and 2716 -LRB- city \/ landscape classification and further classification of landscape images -RRB- images .
based on the above observations , we use edge direction features -LRB- histograms and coherence vectors -RRB- for city \/ landscape classification and color features -LRB- histograms , coherence vectors , and spatial moments -RRB- in and color space for further classification of landscape images -LSB- 25 -RSB- , -LSB- 38 -RSB- , -LSB- 42 -RSB- .
the best classification accuracies achieved for each of the classifiers were 95.9 % for the city \/ landscape classifier -LRB- on 2716 images -RRB- and 94.6 % for the indoor \/ outdoor classifier -LRB- on 5081 images -RRB- , versus 97.0 % and 95.7 % , respectively , for the classifiers trained on the entire database .
this approach has the following advantages : small number of codebook vectors represent a particular class of images , regardless of the size of the training set ; it naturally allows for the integration of multiple features through the class-conditional densities ; it not only provides a classification rule , but also assigns a degree of confidence in the classification , which may be used to build a reject option .
