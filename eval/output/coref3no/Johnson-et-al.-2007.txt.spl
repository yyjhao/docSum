the idea behind significance pruning of phrasetables is that not all of the phrase pairs in a phrasetable are equally supported by the data and that many of the weakly supported pairs could be removed because : the chance of them occurring again might be low , and their occurrence in the given corpus may be the result of an artifact -LRB- a combination of effects where several estimates artificially compensate for one another -RRB- .
phrase pairs that can not stand on their own by demonstrating a certain level of significance are suspect and removing
since the contingency table with c -LRB- s , ~ t -RRB- = 1 having the greatest significance -LRB- lowest p-value -RRB- is the 1-1-1 table , using the threshold of a + e can be used to exclude all of the phrase pairs occurring exactly once -LRB- c -LRB- 9 , ~ t -RRB- = 1 -RRB- .
a special series of runs was done for threshold 14 with all of these singletons removed to see whether at these thresholds it was the significance level or the pruning of phrase pairs with -LRB- c -LRB- ~ s , ~ t -RRB- = 1 -RRB- that was more important .
in particular as discussed above , the most significant of these are the 1-1-1 phrase pairs whose components also only occur once : c -LRB- s -RRB- = 1 , and c -LRB- ~ t -RRB- = 1 .
