corpus heterogeneity previous approaches to relation extraction have employed kernel-based methods -LSB- bunescu and mooney , 2005 -RSB- , maximum-entropy models -LSB- kambhatla , 2004 -RSB- , graphical models -LSB- rosario and hearst , 2004 ; culotta et al. , 2006 -RSB- , and co-occurrence statistics -LSB- lin and pantel , 2001 ; ciaramita et al. , 2005 -RSB- over small , domain-specific corpora and limited sets of relations .
extractions take the form
on average , a web page in our corpus contains 18 sentences , making textrunner s average processing speed per document 0.65 cpu seconds and the total cpu time to extract tuples from our 9 million web page corpus less than 68 cpu hours .
even though they were run over the same 9 million page corpus , textrunner s distributed extraction process took a total of 85 cpu hours , to perform extraction for all relations in the corpus at once , whereas knowitall , which analyzed all sentences in the corpus that potentially matched its rules , took an average of 6.3 hours per relation .
specifically , the tuples we evaluated met the following criteria : 1 -RRB- textrunner assigned a probability of at least 0.8 to the tuple ; 2 -RRB- the tuple s relation is supported by at least 10 distinct sentences in the corpus ; 3 -RRB- the tuple s relation is not found to be in the top 0.1 % of relations by number of supporting sentences .
