however , recent years have seen rapid growth in on-line discussion groups and review sites -LRB- e.g. , the new york times books web page -RRB- where a crucial characteristic of the posted articles is their sentiment , or overall opinion towards the subject matter for example , whether a product review is positive or negative .
these experiments also provide us with baselines for experimental comparison ; in particular , the third baseline of 69 % might actually be considered somewhat difficult to beat , since it was achieved by examination of the test data -LRB- although our examination was rather cursory ; we do 4later experiments using these words as features for machine learning methods did not yield better results .
because training maxent is expensive in the number of features , we limited consideration to -LRB- 1 -RRB- the 16165 unigrams appearing at least four times in our 1400 - document corpus -LRB- lower count cutoffs did not yield significantly different results -RRB- , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the 16165 bigrams occurring most often in the same data -LRB- the selected bigrams all occurred at least seven times -RRB- .
on the other hand , in topic-based classification , all three classifiers have been reported to use bagof-unigram features to achieve accuracies of 90 % and above for particular categories -LRB- joachims , 1998 ; nigam et al. , 1999 -RRB- 9 and such results are
