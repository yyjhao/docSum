given a large corpus -LRB- such as the web -RRB- and two or more examples of some concept x , automatically generate examples of one or more relations r c x x y , where y is some concept and r is some binary relationship between elements of x and elements of y. studying relationships between tagged named entities , -LRB- hasegawa et al , 2004 ; hassan et al , 2006 -RRB- proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given -LRB- or semi-automatically extracted -RRB- sets of pairs into several clusters , where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type .
however , each
if the s-patterns in a given s-group actually capture some relationship between s and the target , then one would expect that similar groups would appear for a multiplicity of concept words s. suppose that we have s-groups for three different concept words s such that the pairwise overlap among the three groups is more than 2 \/ 3 -LRB- where for this purpose two patterns are deemed identical if they differ only at s and x -RRB- .
for purposes of evaluation , we ran our algorithm on three representative domains -- countries , fish species and star constellations -- and tracked down gold standard resources -LRB- encyclopedias , academic texts , informative websites , etc -RRB- for the bulk of the relations generated in each domain .
