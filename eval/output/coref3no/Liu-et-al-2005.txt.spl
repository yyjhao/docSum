our work is related but quite different from sentiment classification -LSB- e.g. , 8 , 9 , 15 , 29 , 30 , 32 , 33 , 35 -RSB- .
given a set of products -LRB- which may be from the same brand or different brands -RRB- and a set of urls of web pages that contain customer reviews , opinion observer works in two stages : stage 1 : extracting and analyzing customer reviews in two steps : step 1 : this step automatically connects to and downloads all customer reviews from the given pages .
terminology finding and entity extraction there are basically two techniques for terminology finding : symbolic approaches that rely on noun phrases , and statistical approaches that exploit the fact that words composing a term tend to be found close to each other and reoccurring -LSB- e.g. , 4 , 7 , 18 , 19 -RSB- .
after that , we discuss the new automatic technique for identifying product features from pros and
our task : in order to visually compare consumer opinions on a set of products , we need to analyze the reviews in ri of each product pi -LRB- 1 -RRB- to find all the explicit and implicit product features on which reviewers have expressed their -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- opinions , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to produce the positive opinion set and the negative opinion set for each feature .
