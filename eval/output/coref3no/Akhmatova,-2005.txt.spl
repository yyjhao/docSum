we represent meaning of a sentence as a set of atomic propositions contained in it and compare the propositions in order to compare the sentences .
to break a sentence into its atomic propositions a syntax-driven semantic analysis of the sentence -LRB- jurafsky and martin , 2000 -RRB- is applied , as we believe that a deep semantic and syntactical analysis is vital to solve the problem .
as it compares senses of the words , a wsd algorithm could be used -LRB- will be in future -RRB- prior to the comparison to get a more reliable score -LRB- otherwise the probability that the current word has sense
we use the length of a path -LRB- take overbuy has a length 2 , form-make-establish has a length 3 ; the longer the path , the less is the relatedness -RRB- ; the amount of sense of the words that is on the path between these two words -LRB- two words connected with a verb print , for example , are more close to each other , as the words connected via make , because print has only 4 senses and make has 49 -RRB- ; and the total number of different paths -LRB- the words which senses are connected through 10 different paths are more related then the words having only one connecting path , for example -RRB- .
