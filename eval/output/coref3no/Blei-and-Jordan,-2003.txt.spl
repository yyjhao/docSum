examples of such data include images and their captions , papers and their bibliographies , and genes and their functions .
we are interested in models that can perform three tasks : modeling the joint distribution of an image and its caption , modeling
the independence assumptions of the corr-lda model are a compromise between the extreme correspondence enforced by the gm-mixture model , where the entire image and caption are conditional on the same factor , and the lack of correspondence in the gm-lda model , where the image regions and caption words can conceivably be conditional on two disparate sets of factors .
under the corr-lda model , the regions of the image can be conditional on any ensemble of factors but the words of the caption must be conditional on factors which are present in the image .
given a segmented image without its caption , we can use the mixture models described in section 3 to compute a distribution over words conditioned on the image , p -LRB- w i r -RRB- .
second , gm-lda easily allows caption words to be generated by factors that did not contribute to generating the image regions -LRB- e.g. , when k = 200 , 54 % of the caption words in the test set are assigned to factors that do not appear in their corresponding images -RRB- .
