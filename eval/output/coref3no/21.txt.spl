our first model is a discriminative approach that models the problem as that of deciding whether any two names mentioned in a collection of documents represent the same entity .
in its most general form , our model assumes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a joint distribution over entities , so that a document that mentions president kennedy is more likely to mention oswald or white house than roger clemens ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- an author model , which makes sure that at least one mention of a name in a document is easily identifiable -LRB- after all , that is the authors goal -RRB- , and then generates other mentions via -LRB- 3 -RRB- an appearance model , governing how mentions are transformed from the representative mention .
e.g. , for the pairs -LRB- john kennedy , john kennedy -RRB- and -LRB- john kennedy , john kennedy davis -RRB- , the active relational features are identical ; but , the first pair activates the structural features -LRB- 1 , 2 -RRB- and -LRB- 1 , 2 -RRB- , while the second pair activates -LRB- 1 , 3 -RRB- and -LRB- 1 , 2 , ^ -RRB- .
in the e-step , we seek -LRB- edt + 1 , rdt + 1 -RRB- for each document d that maximizes p -LRB- dt + 1 | ^ t + 1 -RRB- where dt + 1 = -LCB- -LRB- edt + 1 , rd t + 1 , md -RRB- -RCB- .
these include -LRB- 1 -RRB- incorporating more contextual information -LRB- like time and place -RRB- related to the target entities , both to support a
