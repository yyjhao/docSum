researchers have already investigated issues such as identifying repetitions or contradictions across input documents and determining which information is salient enough to include in the summary -LRB- barzilay , mckeown , &amp; elhadad , 1999 ; carbonell &amp; goldstein , 1998 ; elhadad &amp; mckeown , 2001 ; mani &amp; bloedorn , 1997 ; mckeown , klavans , hatzivassiloglou , barzilay , &amp; eskin , 1999 ; radev &amp; mckeown , 1998 ; white , korelsky , cardie , ng , pierce , &amp; wagstaff , 2001 -RRB- .
our evaluation of plausible strategies measured the usefulness of a chronological ordering algorithm used in previous summarization systems -LRB- mckeown et al. , 1999 ; lin &amp; hovy , 2001 -RRB- as well as an alternative , original strategy , majority ordering .
we evaluated this system through the document understanding conference 2001 -LRB- duc -RRB- 2 evaluation , where summaries produced by several systems were graded by human judges according to different criteria , among them how well the information contained in the summary is ordered .
themes are sets of sentences from different documents that contain repeated information and do not necessarily contain sentences from all the documents -LRB- see two examples of themes in figure 2 -RRB- .
for each theme , the generation component -LRB- barzilay et al. , 1999 -RRB- identifies phrases which are in the intersection of
in the first stage , for each pair of themes a and b , we compute the ratio # ab + \/ # ab to measure the relatedness of two themes .
