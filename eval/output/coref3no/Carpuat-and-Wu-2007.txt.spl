however , most of previous research has focused on using multilingual resources typically used in smt systems to improve wsd accuracy , e.g. , dagan and itai -LRB- 1994 -RRB- , li and li -LRB- 2002 -RRB- , diab -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
in order to closely integrate wsd predictions into the smt system , we need to formulate wsd models
in addition to the widely used bleu -LRB- papineni et al. , 2002 -RRB- and nist -LRB- doddington , 2002 -RRB- scores , we also evaluate translation quality with the recently proposed meteor -LRB- banerjee and lavie , 2005 -RRB- and four edit-distance style metrics , word error rate -LRB- wer -RRB- , position - independent word error rate -LRB- per -RRB- -LRB- tillmann et al. , 1997 -RRB- , cder , which allows block reordering -LRB- leusch et al. , 2006 -RRB- , and translation edit rate -LRB- ter -RRB- -LRB- snover et al. , 2006 -RRB- .
we have proposed to consistently integrate wsd models both during training , where sense definitions and sense-annotated data are automatically extracted from the word-aligned parallel corpora from smt training , and during testing , where the phrasal wsd probabilities are used by the smt system just like all the other lexical choice features .
for instance , incorporating wsd predictions into an mt decoder based on inversion transduction grammars -LRB- wu , 1997 -RRB- such as the bracketing itg based models of wu -LRB- 1996 -RRB- , zens et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , or cherry and lin -LRB- 2007 -RRB- would present an intriguing comparison with the present work .
