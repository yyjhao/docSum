section 4 describes a method for learning semantic classification rules , while section 5 shows the results obtained for discovering the part-whole relations by applying the classification rules on two distinct test corpora .
based on psycholinguistic experiments and the way in which the parts contribute to the structure of the wholes , winston , chaffin , and hermann -LRB- 1987 -RRB- determined six types of part-whole relations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- component-integral object , -LRB- 2 -RRB- member-collection , -LRB- 3 -RRB- portion-mass , -LRB- 4 -RRB- stuff-object , -LRB- 5 -RRB- feature-activity , and -LRB- 6 -RRB- place-area .
in the
the learning tree has two types of nodes : unambiguous nodes , corresponding to the sets of unambiguous examples from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.1 , 1.3.1 , and 1.4.1 from figure 3 -RRB- and ambiguous nodes , corresponding to each ambiguous example from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.2,1.3,1.4 , and 1.4.2 from figure 3 -RRB- .
in order to test the classification rules for the extraction of part-whole relations , we selected two different text collections : the la times news articles from trec 9 and the wall street journal -LRB- wsj -RRB- articles from treebank2 .10 from each collection we randomly selected 10,000 sentences that formed two distinct test corpora .
we defined the task as a binary classification problem and used an approach that relies on the assumption that the semantic relation between two constituent nouns representing the part and the whole can be detected based on the components - semantic classification rules .
