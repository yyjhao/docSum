rather than using simple heuristics , we present results with two statistical frameworks for addressing this problem : one based on link structure , and another based on the recently introduced multi-way distributional clustering method -LSB- 3 -RSB- .
we basically have three possibilities for performing the double clustering : we can use a top-down clustering scheme for both , we can cluster both by a bottom-up scheme , or we can apply a top-down scheme to one of the two clustering systems , while applying a bottom-up scheme to another one .
since in both solutions of the web appearance disambiguation problem -LRB- link structure method and the a \/ cdc method -RRB- we build one group of relevant web pages , we can attempt to overlap the groups built by the two methods .
it can be seen in the graph that when the recall of the relevant cluster is around 45 % -LRB- there are five clusters overall -RRB- , the precision is very high -LRB- above 98 % -RRB- .3 this cluster contains two pages of bill mark the sri manager and none of the
among the 12 people in our dataset ten have homepages -LRB- david mulford and lynn voss do not maintain homepages -RRB- , and nine of the ten homepages are inside the class of relevant documents found by the ls + a \/ cdc hybrid method .
