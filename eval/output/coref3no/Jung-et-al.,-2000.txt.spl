in such
in this paper , we present a statistical method to transliterate english words in korean alphabet to generate various candidates .
in section 2 , we describe alignment and syllabification methods , and in section 3 , mathematical formulation for a statistical model is presented .
section 4 provides experimental results , and finally , we state our conclusions .
first of all , we generate a mapping between english and korean phonetic unit pairs -LRB- table 6 -RRB- .
when a given english pronunciation can be syllabificated into serveral units or a single composite unit , we adopt a heuristic that only the composite unit consisting of longer phonetic units is considered .
in this case , the complex pronunciation '' @ r '' is treated as one phonetic unit .
table 6 shows the examples of phonetic units and their mapping to korean .
the alignment process in training consists of two stages .
for the evaluation we constructed a training corpus of 8368 english-korean word pairs .
table 1 shows the estimated recall values for the 10best results generated by the tagger and for the case when transcription automata used as well .
another significant difference is that lee 's model uses only conventional information sources such as a bigram while our model use various information sources from extended markov window .
