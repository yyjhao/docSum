we present experiments in both an email clustering domain , and in a second document clustering domain -LRB- 20 newsgroups -RRB- showing the performance of this clustering approach .
the key difference between the standard model and our speclustering model is that our model assumes each document is generated by a mixture of two multinomials -LCB- one associated with the document s cluster , and the other shared across all clusters .
the simple method inherits previous clustering results which the user gives her feedback upon and for removed clusters , we reset the initial value of p -LRB- si1di ; bt -RRB- by distributing the probability mass uniformly among all clusters and halving the probability for the cluster s. the joint method uses feedback jointly to initialize the model .
for type 3 and 4 feedback , we adjust the value of p -LRB- xis = 11si = c , ois = v ; bt -RRB- to be one if the keyword \/ person-to-activity bound is confirmed by the user or set it to zero if the bound is disapproved by the user .
we don t put constraints on how the reviewer does the feedback , so the reviewer can make decisions freely based on how she perceives the clustering results , and gives feedback using her own interpretation of the results .
