the sd evaluations on wsj and genia -LRB- tables 4 and 5 -RRB- show little difference in the results obtained with the three parsers -LRB- enju , c &amp; j and ch -RRB- , even though enju uses a significantly different parsing approach .
based on the gr and sd proposals for parser evaluation described in section 3 , we performed evaluations for different parsers in two different domains : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the wsj section of the ptb , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- biomedical abstracts from the genia treebank .
for example , the parc 700 dependencybank -LRB- king et al. , 2003 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of lfg parsers -LRB- kaplan et al. , 2004 ; burke et al. , 2004 -RRB- , a ccg tree - bank -LRB- ccgbank -RRB- -LRB- hockenmaier and steedman , 2002 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of ccg parsing models -LRB- hockenmaier , 2003 ; clark and curran , 2004 -RRB- , and hpsg treebanks , which were created manually -LRB- oepen et al. , 2004 -RRB- or derived from ptb data -LRB- miyao et al. , 2005 -RRB- , were used for the evaluation of hpsg parsers -LRB- toutanova et al. , 2004 ; miyao and tsujii , 2005 ; ninomiya et al. , 2007 ; sagae et al. , 2007 -RRB- .
conversion to shallow ptb trees was done by mapping tree patterns from enju 's phrase structure output into the corresponding shallow ptb tree patterns , and conversion to sd was done by first converting enju 's output to shallow ptb format , then
