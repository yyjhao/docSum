other approaches exploit similarities in aligned bilingual corpora ; for example , -LRB- tao et al. , 2006 -RRB- combine two unsupervised methods .
the remainder of this section provides details about these stages ; the basic formulation of the transliteration model and the feature extraction scheme is described in section 2.1 , in section 2.2 the selective sampling process is described and finally section 2.3 explains how learning is focused by using feature weights .
our transliteration model takes a discriminative approach ; the classifier is presented with a word pair -LRB- ws , wt -RRB- , where ws is a named entity and it is asked to determine whether wt is a transliteration of the ne in the target language .
our initial feature extraction scheme follows the one presented in -LRB- klementiev and roth , 2006 -RRB- , in which the feature space consists of n-gram pairs from the two languages .
we evaluated our approach in two settings ; first , we compared our system to a baseline system described in -LRB- klementiev and roth , 2006 -RRB- .
three variations were tested - training without feature weights , using the feature weights
in this paper we presented a new approach for constructing a transliteration model automatically and efficiently by selectively extracting transliteration samples covering relevant parts of the feature space and focusing the learning process on these features .
