so again , the score is the ratio between d -LRB- the sum of weights of scus expressed in the summary -RRB- and max -LRB- the optimal score of a summary of size x , -RRB- , but this time x is not the scu length of the evaluated peer , but rather the average number of scus in the model summaries used for the creation of the pyramid , xa .
the x-axis on the plot shows how many summaries were used in the pyramid -LRB- and in brackets , the number of pyramids of that size that could be constructed with the nine available model summaries -RRB- and the y-axis shows the
the two variants of the pyramid scores -LRB- original and modified -RRB- are very highly correlated , with pearsons correlation coefficient of 0.96 ; so are the two automatic metrics as well -LRB- p = 0.98 -RRB- , indicating that the two pairs of metrics are mutually redundant .
the approach that teufel and halteren take is the following : they resample their pool of summaries -LRB- with possible repetitions -RRB- in order to get sets of n summaries for different values of n. then for each pool of summaries derived in this manner , they score summaries against the factoid inventory using the weight of factoids in the peer summaries -LRB- without the normalization factor we propose -RRB- .
