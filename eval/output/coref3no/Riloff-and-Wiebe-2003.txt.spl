the second emphasis of our research is using extraction patterns to represent subjective expressions .
the high-precision classifiers label a sentence as subjective or objective when they are confident about the classification , and they leave a sentence unlabeled otherwise .
most of these algorithms require special training resources , such as texts annotated with domain-specific tags -LRB- e.g. , autoslog -LRB- riloff , 1993 -RRB- , crystal -LRB- soderland et al. , 1995 -RRB- , rapier -LRB- califf , 1998 -RRB- , srv -LRB- freitag , 1998 -RRB- , whisk -LRB- soderland , 1999 -RRB- -RRB- or manually defined keywords , frames , or object recognizers -LRB- e.g. , palka -LRB- kim and moldovan , 1993 -RRB- and liep -LRB- huffman , 1996 -RRB- -RRB- .
we have developed a bootstrapping process for subjectivity classification that explores three ideas : -LRB- 1 -RRB- high - precision classifiers can be used to automatically identify subjective and objective sentences from unannotated texts , -LRB- 2 -RRB- this data can be used as a training set to automatically learn extraction patterns associated with subjectivity , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the learned patterns can be used to grow the training set , allowing this entire process to be bootstrapped .
for previously unlabeled sentences , the new version classifies a sentence as subjective if -LRB- 1 -RRB- it contains two or more of the learned patterns , or -LRB- 2 -RRB- it contains one of the clues used by the original hpsubj classifier and at least one learned pattern .
