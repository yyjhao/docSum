next , we iterate through each of the possible hypernym synsets l under which we might add the new word i ; for each synset l we compute the change in taxonomy score resulting from adding the implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- required by the taxonomic constraints of t. since typically our set of all evidence involving i will be much smaller than the set of possible relations in i -LRB- h1 gl -RRB- , we may efficiently check whether , for each sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , for all words where we have some evidence ergw , whether s participates in some relation with i in the set of implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- .7 if there is more than one sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , we add to i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- the single relationship rgs that maximizes the taxonomy likelihood , i.e. argmaxs ^ senses -LRB- w -RRB- at -LRB- rgs -RRB- .
in our algorithm word sense disambiguation is an implicit side-effect of our algorithm ; since our algorithm chooses to add the single link which , with its implied links , yields the most likely taxonomy , and since each distinct synset in wordnet has a different immediate neighborhood of relations , our algorithm simply disambiguates each node based on its surrounding structural information .
in section 4.1 we describe our evaluation methodology ; in
