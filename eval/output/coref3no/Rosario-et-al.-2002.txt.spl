we also analyzed 21 of the 90 cps for which the second noun was h01 -LRB- natural sciences -RRB- ; we decided to analyze this portion of the mesh hierarchy because the ncs with h01 as second noun are frequent in our collection , and because we wanted to test the hypothesis that we do indeed need to descend farther for heterogeneous parts of mesh .
finally , we analyzed three cps in category c -LRB- diseases -RRB- ; the most frequent cp in terms of the total number of non-unique ncs is c04 -LRB- neoplasms -RRB- a1 1 -LRB- cells -RRB- , with 30606 ncs ; the second cp was a10 c04 -LRB- 27520 total ncs -RRB- and the fifth most frequent , a01 c04 , with 20617 total ncs ; we analyzed these cps .
for 55 -LRB- 22 % -RRB- of the cps we had to descend 1 level -LRB- e.g. , a01 m01 : a01 m01 .898 , a01 m01 .643 -RRB- and for 7 cps -LRB- 2 % -RRB- we descended two levels .
for cps with h01 as the second noun , of
this fits nicely with our method of describing the ncs with the higher levels of the hierarchy : if most of the ambiguity is at the highest levels -LRB- as these results show -RRB- , information about lexical ambiguity is not lost when we describe the ncs using the higher levels of mesh .
