most systems that generate extraction patterns automatically use special training resources , such as texts annotated with domain-specific tags -LRB- e.g. , autoslog -LRB- riloff 1993 ; 1996a -RRB- , crystal -LRB- soderland et al. 1995 -RRB- , rapier -LRB- califf 1998 -RRB- , srv -LRB- freitag 1998 -RRB- , whisk -LRB- soderland 1999 -RRB- -RRB- or
for example , an ie system to identify locations might use a semantic lexicon that lists country names and the 50 u.s. states , and then rely on extraction patterns to recognize other location phrases such as cities , neighborhoods , and general descriptions like '' downtown '' or '' northwest region '' .
we preprocessed the web pages first by removing html tags and adding periods to separate independent phrases .3 autoslog generated 19,690 candidate extraction patterns from the web page training set , and 14,064 candidate extraction patterns from the terrorism training set .4 then we ran the meta-bootstrapping algorithm on three semantic categories for the web pages -LRB- locations , person titles , and companies -RRB- , and two semantic categories for the terrorism articles -LRB- locations and weapons -RRB- .
we also plan to consider schemes for allowing both the semantic lexicon and the extraction patterns to vote on possible extractions .
our bootstrapping method has two advantages over previous techniques for learning information extraction dictionaries : both a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns are acquired simultaneously , and no special training resources are needed .
