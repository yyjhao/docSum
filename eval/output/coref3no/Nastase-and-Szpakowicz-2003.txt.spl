we explore available lexical resources -LRB- wordnet and roget 's thesaurus -RRB- to provide the attributes , and machine learning -LRB- ml -RRB- tools to find the most salient combinations of attributes .
the distance between the two heads or two modifiers in a pair of base nps can be zero , yet there may be no similarity between them , with respect to semantic relations .
a discussion of the attributes that characterize the data , collected from wordnet1 .6 and roget 's is presented in section 5 .
they learn semantic relations between a noun and its modifier in a medical domain , to which the list of semantic relations and the lexical resource have been tailored .
the results obtained show that the correct roget 's sense can be selected from the first two senses indicated by our simple algorithm in 86.02 % of the cases .
because of the words that do not have a corresponding sense in roget 's , our data set is reduced to 555 base noun phrases , with the distribution presented in table 2 .
we can look at the attributes , and combinations of attributes , picked by the system as best discriminating between positive and negative examples , and understand the connection between data clumped together by decision trees or rules .
we have run the learning
