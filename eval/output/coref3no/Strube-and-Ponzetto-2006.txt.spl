semantic relatedness measures are used in many applications in natural language processing -LRB- nlp -RRB- such as word sense disambiguation -LRB- patwardhan et al. , 2005 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 -RRB- , interpretation of noun compounds -LRB- kim &amp; baldwin , 2005 -RRB- and spelling correction -LRB- budanitsky &amp; hirst , 2006 -RRB- .
since the edge counting approach relies on a uniform modeling of the hierarchy , researchers started to develop measures for computing semantic relatedness which abstract from this problem -LRB- wu &amp; palmer , 1994 ; resnik , 1995 ; leacock &amp; chodorow , 1998 ; finkelstein et al. , 2002 ; banerjee &amp; pedersen , 2003 , inter alia -RRB- .
leacock &amp; chodorow -LRB- 1998 , lch -RRB- propose a normalized path-length measure which takes into account the depth of the taxonomy in which the concepts are found where length -LRB- c1 , c2 -RRB- is the number of nodes along the shortest path between the two nodes -LRB- as given by the edge counting method -RRB- , and d is the maximum depth of the taxonomy .
we evaluated the relatedness measures on three standard datasets , namely miller &amp; charles -LRB- 1991 -RRB- list of 30 noun pairs -LRB- m &amp; c -RRB- , the 65 word synonymity list from rubenstein &amp; goodenough -LRB- 1965 , r &amp; g -RRB- of which m &amp; c is a subset , and finally the wordsimilarity-353 test collection -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 , 353-tc -RRB- 3 .
we report in tables 2 and 3 the muc score -LRB- vilain et al. , 1995 -RRB- with performances
