we then describe the prototype system , consisting of a visualization component -LRB- section 3.1 -RRB- , a simple but effective clustering algorithm -LRB- section 3.2 -RRB- , and a machine-learned classifier that can be rapidly trained for a new domain -LRB- section 3.3 -RRB- by bootstrapping from a relatively small set of labeled data .
once the sentences for a make and model of car have been assigned to clusters and have received a sentiment score from the sentiment classifier , the visualization component -LRB- section 3.1 -RRB- displays the clusters and the keyword labels that were produced for the sentences associated with that car .
by choosing a menu option , the user can view a summary of the clusters in the form of simple top five lists , where for a given make \/ model the top five terms overall , the top five positive terms and the top five negative terms are displayed .
go words and the two tf idf weighting schemes each re-rank the clusters , and finally some of the clusters are merged and a fixed number of clusters is selected off the top of the ranked list for display .
the data set shows a clear skew towards positive reviews : in the annotated data set , positive sentences comprise 62.33 % of the data , sentences of type other comprise 23.27 % , and negative sentences 14.4 % .
