consider , for example , the predicate hyponytn
initially we discovered patterns -LRB- 1 -RRB- - -LRB- 3 -RRB- by observation , looking through text and noticing the patterns and the relationships they indicate , in order to find new patterns automatically , we sketch the following procedure : decide on a lexical relation , 11 , that is of interest , e.g. , '' group \/ member '' -LRB- in our formulation this is a subset of the hyponymy relation -RRB- .
it may be the case that in english the hyponymy relation is especially amenable to this kind of analysis , perhaps due to its '' naming '' nature , however , we have had some success at identification of more specific relations , such as patterns that indicate certain types of proper nouns .
when the set of 152 grolier ' s relations was looked up in wordnet , 180 out of the 226 unique words involved in the relations actually existed in the hierarchy , and 61 out of the 106 feasible relations -LRB- i.e. , relations in which both terms were already registered in word - net -RRB- were found .
furthermore , since we 've assumed the hyponym has only one main sense we could do the following : look through a corpus for occurrences of the hyponym and see if its environment tends to be similar to one of the senses of its hypernym .
