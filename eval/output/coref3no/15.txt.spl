for instance , if the validation statement is the capital of usa is washington , we have web documents containing passages like those reported in table 1 , which can not be found with a simple search of the statement , but that
we will make use of validation patterns that cover a larger portion of text fragments , including those lexically similar to the question and the answer -LRB- e.g. fragments 4 and 5 in table 1 -RRB- and also those that are not similar -LRB- e.g. fragment 2 in table 1 -RRB- .
compute the set of representative keywords and both from and from , this step is carried out using linguistic techniques , such as answer type identification -LRB- from the question -RRB- and named entities recognition -LRB- from the answer -RRB- ; from the extracted keywords compute the validation pattern for the pair ; submit the validation pattern to a search engine ; estimate an answer relevance score -LRB- ars -RRB- considering the results returned by the search engine .
the search of the pattern -LSB- river near us near -LRB- known or know o r ... -RRB- near big near muddy -RSB- returns 0 pages , so the algorithm relaxes the pattern by cutting the initial noun river , according to the heuristic for discarding a noun if it is the first keyword of the question .
