in this paper we : motivate the problem with storing enumerated phrases in a
this is entirely a practical suggestion for keeping the phrase table to a reasonable size , since they measure minor but incremental improvement in translation quality up to their maximum tested phrase length of seven words .1 table 4 gives statistics about phrases which occur more than once in the english section of the europarl corpus -LRB- koehn , 2002 -RRB- which was used in the koehn et al. -LRB- 2003 -RRB- experiments .
in order to adapt suffix arrays to be useful for statistical machine translation we need a data structure with the following elements : a suffix array created from the source language portion of the corpus , and another created from the target language portion of the corpus , an index that tells us the correspondence between sentence numbers and positions in the source and target language corpora , an alignment a for each sentence pair in the parallel corpus , where a is defined as a subset of the cartesian product of the word positions in a sentence e of length i and a sentence f of length j : a method for extracting the translationally equivalent phrase for a subphrase given an aligned sentence pair containing that sub-phrase .
