traditional question answering -LRB- qa -RRB- systems typically employ a pipeline approach , consisting roughly of question analysis , document \/ passage retrieval , and answer selection -LRB- see e.g. , -LRB- prager et al. , 2000 ; moldovan et al. , 2000 ; hovy et al. , 2001 ; clarke et al. , 2001 -RRB- -RRB- .
in our question answering system , piquant , we utilize in parallel multiple answering agents that adopt different processing strategies and consult different knowledge sources in identifying answers to given questions , and we employ resolution mechanisms to combine the results produced by the individual answering agents .
in order to enable a multi-source and multi-strategy approach to question answering , we developed a modular and extensible qa architecture as shown in figure 1 -LRB- chu-carroll et
the candidate answers in these passages are identified and ranked based on three criteria : 1 -RRB- match in semantic type between candidate answer and expected answer , 2 -RRB- match in weighted grammatical relationships between question and answer passages , and 3 -RRB- frequency of answer in candidate passages -LRB- redundancy -RRB- .
third , passages from agent 2 may contain additional occurrences of the correct answer , which boosts the system s confidence in the answer through the redundancy measure .2 our passage-level combination algorithm adds to the passages extracted by the knowledge-based agent the top - ranked passages from the statistical agent that contain candidate answers of the right type .
