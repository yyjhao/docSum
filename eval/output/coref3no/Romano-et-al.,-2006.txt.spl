next , we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web -LRB- szpektor et al. , 2004 -RRB- , the minipar dependency parser -LRB- lin , 1998 -RRB- and a syntactic matching module .
more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing variables , e.g. x buy y q x purchase y. under a syntactic representation , a template is a parsed text fragment , e.g. x s + interact md ^ with ~ n y -LRB- based on the syntactic dependency relations of the minipar parser -RRB- .
the matcher processes a sentence in 3 steps : 1 -RRB- parsing the sentence with the minipar parser , obtaining a dependency graph 2 ; 2 -RRB- matching each template against the sentence dependency graph ; 3 -RRB- extracting candidate term pairs that match the template variables .
to handle transparent head nouns , which is the only phenomenon that demonstrates domain dependence , we extracted a set of the 5 most frequent transparent head patterns in the development set , e.g. fragment of x. in order to compare -LRB- roughly -RRB- our performance with supervised methods applied to this dataset , as summarized in -LRB- bunescu et al. , 2005 -RRB- , we adopted their recall and precision measurement .
two targets were investigated : -LRB- a -RRB- a mostly unsupervised , domain independent , configuration for re , and -LRB- b -RRB- an evaluation scheme for paraphrase acquisition , providing a first
