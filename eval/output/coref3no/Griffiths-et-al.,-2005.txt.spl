words that play different roles are treated differently in human language processing : function and content words produce different patterns of brain activity -LSB- 1 -RSB- , and have different developmental trends -LSB- 2 -RSB- .
hmms and probabilistic context-free grammars -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- 5 -RSB- -RRB- generate documents purely based on syntactic relations among unobserved word classes , while bag-of-words models like naive bayes or topic models -LRB- e.g. , -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- generate documents based on semantic correlations between words , independent of word order .
in addition to running the composite model with t = 200 and c = 20 , we examined two special cases : t = 200 , c = 2 , being a model where the only hmm classes are the start \/ end and semantic classes , and thus equivalent to latent dirichlet allocation -LRB- lda ; -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- ; and t = 1 , c = 20 , being an hmm in which the semantic class distribution does not vary across documents , and simply has a different hyperparameter from the other classes .
on the brown corpus , we ran samplers for lda and 1 st , 2nd , and 3rd order hmm and composite models , with three chains of 4000 iterations each , taking samples at a lag of 100 iterations after a burn-in of 2000 iterations .
for example , replacing the content words that the model identifies in the second sentence with content words appropriate to
