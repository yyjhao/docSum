for these reasons we chose hawkins list of definite description uses -LRB- hawkins , 1978 -RRB- and princes taxonomy -LRB- prince , 1981 ; prince , 1992 -RRB- as our starting point , and we developed from there two slightly different annotation schemes , which allowed us to see whether it was better to describe the classes to our annotators in a surface-oriented or a semantic fashion , and to evaluate the seriousness of the problems with these schemes identified in the literature -LRB- see , e.g. , -LRB- fraurud , 1990 -RRB- -RRB- .
we also replaced the anaphoric -LRB- same head -RRB- class we had
all four of the possible combinations of total disagreement were observed , but the two most common combinations were bcu -LRB- bridging , co-referential , and unfamiliar -RRB- and blu -LRB- bridging , larger situation , and unfamiliar -RRB- ; all six combinations of partial disagreements were also observed .
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
