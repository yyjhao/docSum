thus it is important to be able to normalize or paraphrase the citances for many applications , including indexing in a database or an ir system , document summarization -LSB- 4 , 3 -RSB- , learning synonyms -LSB- 16 , 17 -RSB- , building a model of the different expressions of the same relationship for ie -LSB- 30 , 29 -RSB- , extracting patterns for question answering -LSB- 20 -RSB- , machine translation -LSB- 26 -RSB- .
in the next subsections we describe how these paraphrases are extracted from the citances and present a preliminary evaluation of the results for one set of citances .
a paraphrase was judged acceptable , if it was not bad and : -LRB- 1 -RRB- it contained additional terms -LRB- e.g. , dp5 protein -RRB- or topics -LRB- e.g. , prepositional phrases like in sympathetic neurons -RRB- ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- the
table 1 shows there is a significant drop in correctness when going from set 2 to set 3 -LRB- see the first column labeled % -RRB- , which supports our hypothesis that citances help focus the paraphrases .
in this work we focused on the extraction of grammatical template-level paraphrases similar to those described by lin and pantel -LSB- 20 -RSB- , and further refined by -LSB- 18 -RSB- , -LSB- 29 -RSB- and -LSB- 30 -RSB- .
we have motivated and discussed the potentially enormous role that the use of sentences surrounding citations , or citances , can have for automated analysis of bioscience literature .
