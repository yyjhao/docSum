such data would be amenable to conventional statistical machine translation -LRB- smt -RRB- techniques -LRB- e.g. , those discussed in och &amp; ney 2003 -RRB- .2 in what follows we compare two strategies for unsupervised construction of such a corpus , one employing string similarity and the other associating sentences that may overlap very little at the string level .
pairings that were identical or differing only by punctuation were rejected , as were those where the shorter sentence in the pair was less than two thirds the length of the longer , this latter constraint in effect placing an upper bound on edit distance relative to the length of the sentence .
a corpus was produced by extracting the first two sentences of each article , then pairing these across documents within each cluster .
the assumption that two first sentences are semantically related is
the f2 data also retains pairs like the following that involve both high-level semantic alternations and long distance dependencies : two men who robbed a jeweller 's shop to raise funds for the bali bombings were each jailed for % % number % % years by indonesian courts today .
following och &amp; ney s methodology , two annotators each created an initial annotation for each dataset , subcategorizing alignments as either sure -LRB- necessary -RRB- or possible -LRB- allowed , but not required -RRB- .
