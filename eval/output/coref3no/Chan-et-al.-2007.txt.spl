for local collocations , we use 3 features , w _ 1w + 1 , w _ 1 , and w + 1 , where w _ 1 -LRB- w + 1 -RRB- is the token immediately
to achieve this , when a grammar rule r is considered during decoding , and we recognize that some of the terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in a are also chosen by the wsd system as translations for some terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in - y , we compute the following features : note that we can take the negative logarithm of the rule \/ derivation weights and think of them as costs rather than probabilities .
in general , the chinese phrase may consist of k chinese words , where k = 1 , 2 , 3 , ... however , we limit k to 1 or 2 for experiments reported in this paper .
when the rule is extracted from the parallel corpus , it has these alignments between the words of its chinese and english portion : -LCB- c1e3 , c2e4 , c3e1 , c3e2 , c3e5 -RCB- , which means that c1 is aligned to e4 , and c3 is aligned to e1 , e2 , and e5 .
following -LRB- chiang , 2005 -RRB- , we used the version 1 1a nist bleu script with its default settings to calculate the bleu scores -LRB- papineni et al. , 2002 -RRB- based on case-insensitive n - gram matching , where n is up to 4 .
