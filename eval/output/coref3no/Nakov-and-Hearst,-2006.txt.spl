what is especially novel about this approach is paraphrasing noun compound semantics in terms of concrete verbs , rather than a fixed number of abstract predicates -LRB- e.g. , have , make , use -RRB- , relations -LRB- e.g. , location , instrument , agent -RRB- , or prepositions -LRB- e.g. , of , for , in -RRB- , as is traditional in the literature .
in the remainder of this paper we first describe related work , then give details of the algorithm , present preliminary results as compared to other work in the literature , and discuss potential applications .
however , some researchers -LRB- e.g. , downing -LSB- 5 -RSB- -RRB- , have proposed that an unlimited number is needed ; in this paper we will hold a similar position .
we believe verbs have more expressive power and are better tailored for
our idea is to preserve the head - modifier relation by substituting the pre-modifier noun , with a suitable post - modifying relative phrase ; e.g. , tear gas can be transformed into gas that causes tears , gas that brings tears , gas which produces tears , etc .
we allow for adjectives and participles to fall between the verb and the preposition , but not nouns ; we ignore the modals , and the auxiliaries , but retain the passive be , and we make sure there is exactly one verb phrase -LRB- thus disallowing complex paraphrases like gas that makes the eyes fill with tears '' -RRB- .
