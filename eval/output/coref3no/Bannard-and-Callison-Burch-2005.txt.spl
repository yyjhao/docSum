the remainder of this paper is as follows : section 2 contrasts our method for extracting paraphrases with the monolingual case , and describes how
section 3 describes our experimental setup and includes information about how phrases were selected , how we manually aligned parts of the bilingual corpus , and how we evaluated the paraphrases .
much previous work on extracting paraphrases -LRB- barzilay and mckeown , 2001 ; barzilay and lee , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2003 -RRB- has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted , and treated as paraphrases .
we evaluated the accuracy of each of the paraphrases that was extracted from the manually aligned data , as well as the top ranked paraphrases from the experimental conditions detailed below in section 3.3 .
we evaluated the accuracy of top ranked paraphrases when the paraphrase probability was calculated using the manual alignments , the automatic alignments , automatic alignments produced over multiple corpora in different languages , all of the above with language model re-ranking , all of the above with the candidate paraphrases limited to the same sense as the original phrase .
in this paper we have introduced a novel method for extracting paraphrases , which we believe greatly increases the usefulness of paraphrasing in nlp applications .
