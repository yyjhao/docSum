finally , in a previous publication -LRB- nakov and hearst , 2006 -RRB- , we make the claim that the relation between the nouns in a noun-noun compound can be characterized by the
given an entity-annotated example sentence , we reduce the target entities e1 and e2 to single nouns noun1 and noun2 , by keeping their last nouns only , which we assume to be the heads .
we then mine the web for sentences containing both noun1 and noun2 , from which we extract features , consisting of word -LRB- s -RRB- , part of speech -LRB- verb , preposition , verb + preposition , coordinating conjunction -RRB- , and whether noun1 precedes noun2 .
coordination : if the two nouns are the heads of two coordinated nps , we extract the coordinating conjunction .
entity word : we also use the lemmas of the words that are part of ei -LRB- i = 1 , 2 -RRB- .
following turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and barker and szpakowicz -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , we used a 1-nearestneighbor classifier .
in fact , our category c system is the best-performing -LRB- in terms of f and acc -RRB- among the participating systems , and we achieved the third best results for category a. our category c results are slightly but consistently better than for a for all measures -LRB- p , r , features used leave-1-out test ucb f , acc -RRB- , which suggests that knowing the query is helpful .
