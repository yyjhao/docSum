as we go , we will indicate the performance of each model on
in all experiments , as is common , we will assume that we have been given as part of our input the true mention boundaries , the head word of each mention and the mention type -LRB- proper , nominal , or pronominal -RRB- .
for each mention in the document , we choose a component -LRB- an entity index -RRB- z from q. entity z is then associated with a multinomial emission distribution over head words with parameters ^ hz , which are drawn from a symmetric dirichlet over possible mention heads with concentration ah .2 note that here the x for a mention consists only of the mention head h. as we enrich our models , we simultaneously develop an accompanying gibbs sampling procedure to obtain samples from p -LRB- zix -RRB- .3 for now , all heads h are observed and all parameters -LRB- q and 0 -RRB- can be integrated out analytically : for details see teh et al. -LRB- 2006 -RRB- .
the choice of entities may reasonably be considered to be independent given the mixing weights q , but how we realize an entity is strongly dependent on context -LRB- ge et al. , 1998 -RRB- .
as in section 3 , we use true mention boundaries and evaluate using the muc f1 measure -LRB- vilain et al. , 1995 -RRB- .
