we make a vector , r , to characterize the relationship between two words , x and y , by counting the frequencies of various short phrases containing x and y. turney and littman -LSB- 2005 -RSB- use a list of 64 joining terms , such as of , for , and to , to form 128 phrases that contain x and y , such as x of y , y of x , x for y , y for x , x to y , and y to x. these phrases are then used as queries for a search engine and the number of hits -LRB- matching documents -RRB- is recorded for each query .
query the search engine for all phrases that begin with one member of the pair and end with the other
calculate relational similarity : the relational similarity between a : b and c : d is the average of the cosines , among the -LRB- num _ filter + 1 -RRB- 2 cosines from step 11 , that are greater than or equal to the cosine of the original pairs , a : b and c : d. the requirement that the cosine must be greater than or equal to the original cosine is a way of filtering out poor analogies , which may be introduced in step 1 and may have slipped through the filtering in step 2 .
