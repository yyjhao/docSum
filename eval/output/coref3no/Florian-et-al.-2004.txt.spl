the entity detection and tracking task -LRB- edt henceforth -RRB- has close ties to the named entity recognition -LRB- ner -RRB- and coreference resolution tasks , which have been the focus of attention of much investigation in the recent past -LRB- bikel et al. , 1997 ; borthwick et al. , 1998 ; mikheev et al. , 1999 ; miller et al. , 1998 ; aberdeen et al. , 1995 ; ng and cardie , 2002 ; soon et al. , 2001 -RRB- , and have been at the center of several evaluations : muc-6 , muc-7 , conll02 and conll03 shared tasks .

the following is a list of additional features -LRB- again , is the current token -RRB- : a capitalization \/ word-type flag -LRB- similar to the ones described by bikel et al. -LRB- 1997 -RRB- -RRB- ; gazetteer information : a handful of location -LRB- 55k entries -RRB- person names -LRB- 30k -RRB- and organizations -LRB- 5k -RRB- dictionaries ; a combination of gazetteer , pos and capitalization information , obtained as follows : if the word is a closed-class word select its class , else if its in a dictionary select that class , otherwise back-off to its capitalization information ; we call this feature gap ; wordnet information -LRB- the synsets and hypernyms of the two most frequent senses of the word -RRB- ; the outputs of three systems -LRB- hmm , rrm and maxent -RRB- trained on a 32-category named entity data , the output of an rrm system trained on the muc-6 data , and the output of rrm model identifying 49 categories .
