chronologically , the first on-topic training document of 20 of the topics were in amj ; 28 of the topics began in jfm and continued into amj ; there were separate training documents in both halves of the corpus for those topics that straddled the two halves .
there are two motivations for splitting the corpus into two development-test sets : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a three month set of documents avoids any corpus-size dependencies that might be present and affect future comparisons with results from tdt-3 corpus -LRB- which covers October , November , and December , 1998 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- having two development-test sets allows us to gauge the size of random variations between different collections of documents and \/ or topics .
the basic idea behind converting a detection system to a tracking system is that as each document is initially considered by the detection system , the system also notes whether it is one of the seed documents of a tracking topic .
as a starting point we present the det curve of a detection system which had excellent performance in the tdt-2 -LSB- 3 -RSB- and tdt-3 -LSB- 4 -RSB- evaluations , converted to a naive tracking system as described above .
this leads us to make two observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a topic detection system well - optimized to the tdt detection task converts into a naive
