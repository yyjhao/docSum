furthermore , our approach has a number of important advantages over existing learning and non-learning methods for coreference resolution : the approach is largely unsupervised , so no annotated training corpus is required .
while human audiences have little trouble mapping a collection of noun phrases onto the same entity , this task of noun phrase -LRB- np -RRB- coreference resolution can present a formidable challenge to an nlp system .
it contains two base noun phrases : chief financial officer and prime corp. each noun phrase in the input text is then represented as a set of 11 features as shown in table 1 .
in contrast to other approaches to coreference resolution , ours is unsupervised and offers several potential advantages over existing methods : no annotated training data is required , the distance metric can be easily extended to account for additional linguistic information as it becomes available to the nlp system , and the clustering approach provides a flexible mechanism for combining a variety of constraints and preferences to impose a partitioning on the noun phrases in a text into coreference equivalence classes .
our current distance metric and noun phrase instance representation are only first , and admittedly very coarse , approximations to those ultimately required for handling the wide variety of anaphoric expressions
