we next validate our hypothesis that conjunctions constrain the orientation of conjoined adjectives and then describe the remaining three steps of the algorithm .
for the log-linear model , we repeatedly partitioned our data into equally sized training and testing sets , estimated the weights on the training set , and scored the model 's performance on the testing set , averaging the
we separated our sets of adjectives a -LRB- containing 1,336 adjectives -RRB- and conjunction - and morphology - based links l -LRB- containing 2,838 links -RRB- into training and testing groups by selecting , for several values of the parameter a , the maximal subset of a , a , , which includes an adjective x if and only if there exist at least a links from l between x and other elements of a , .
these results are extremely significant statistically -LRB- p-value less than 10-16 -RRB- when compared with the baseline method of randomly assigning orientations to adjectives , or the baseline method of always predicting the most frequent -LRB- for types -RRB- category -LRB- 50.82 % of the adjectives in our collection are classified as negative -RRB- .
as we noted earlier , the corpus data is eventually represented in our system as a graph , with the nodes corresponding to adjectives and the links to predictions about whether the two connected adjectives have the same or different orientation .
