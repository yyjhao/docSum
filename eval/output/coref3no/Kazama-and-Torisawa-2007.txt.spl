as a first step towards such approach , we demonstrate in this paper that category labels extracted from the first sentence of a wikipedia article , which can be thought of as the definition of the entity described in the article , are really useful to improve the accuracy of ner .
in our experiments using the conll 2003 ner dataset -LRB- tjong et al. , 2003 -RRB- , we demonstrate that we can improve performance by using the wikipedia features by 1.58 points in f-measure from the baseline , and by 1.21 points from the model that only uses the gazetteers provided in the conll 2003 dataset .
we focus on the first noun phrase after be in the first sentence , while they used all the nouns in the sentence .
after the preprocessing described above , we extracted the first line in the remaining lines as the first sentence from which we extract a category label .
next , we extracted the first noun phrase after the first is , was , are , or were in the sentence .
we did not utilize wikipedias category sections in this study , since a wikipedia
if we could find the category label for the candidate word sequence , we annotated it using iob2 tags in the same way as we represent named entities .
