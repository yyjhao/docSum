in this short paper we describe a system for -LRB- third-person -RRB- pronoun interpretation that is self-trained from raw data , that is , using no annotated training data whatsoever .
the simplification assumed above that coreference holds for all and only those pronouns for which textpro and hard constraints find a single possible antecedent is obviously false , but it nonetheless yields a model to seed the iterative part of the algorithm , which goes as follows : for each pronoun in the training data acquired in step 1 : apply the current maxent model to each pronoun-antecedent pair .
this hope is notwithstanding the fact that the algorithm is based on a simplifying assumption that each pronoun is associated with exactly one correct antecedent that is clearly false for a variety of reasons : -LRB- i -RRB- there will be cases in which there is more than one coreferential antecedent
in accordance with hobbss search procedure , noun groups are searched in the following order : -LRB- i -RRB- in the current sentence from right-to-left , starting with the first noun group to the left of the pronoun , -LRB- ii -RRB- in the previous sentence from left-to-right , -LRB- iii -RRB- in two sentences prior from left-to-right , -LRB- iv -RRB- in the current sentence from left-to-right , starting with the first noun group to the right of the pronoun -LRB- for cataphora -RRB- .
