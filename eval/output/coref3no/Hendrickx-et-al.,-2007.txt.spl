the features that apply to the entities in a relation -LRB- e 1 , e2 -RRB- are extracted for term 1 -LRB- t1 -RRB- and term 2 -LRB- t2 -RRB- of the relation , where t1 is the first term in the relation name , and t2 is the second term .
the corpus was first preprocessed by a lemmatizer and the memory-based shallow parser , and the found verbobject relations were used to cluster nouns in groups .
while the features were selected independently for all relations , the seven classifiers in the wnbased system all make use of the wn semantic class features ; in the system that did not use wn , the seven classifiers make use of the cluster class features instead .
we systematically tested the following algorithms : naivebayes -LRB- nb -RRB- -LRB- langley et al. , 1992 -RRB- , bayesnet -LRB- bn -RRB- -LRB- cooper and herskovits , 1992 -RRB- , j48 -LRB- quinlan , 1993 -RRB- , jrip -LRB- cohen , 1995 -RRB- , ib1 and ibk -LRB- aha et al. , 1991 -RRB- , lwl -LRB- atkeson et al. , 1997 -RRB- , and decision - stumps -LRB- ds -RRB- -LRB- iba and langley , 1992 -RRB- , all with default
the system using all training data with wordnet features , b4 -LRB- table 5 -RRB- , performs better in terms of f-measure on six out of the seven subtasks as compared to the system that does not use the word - net features but the semantic cluster information instead , a4 -LRB- table 4 -RRB- .
