we augmented the baseline model by incorporating the paraphrase probability into an additional feature function which assigns values as follows : just as we did in the baseline system , we performed minimum error rate training to set the weights of the nine feature functions in our translation model that exploits paraphrases .
we evaluated the efficacy of using paraphrases in three ways : by calculating the bleu score for the translated output , by measuring the increase in coverage when including paraphrases , and through a targeted manual evaluation of the phrasal translations of unseen phrases to determine how many of the newly covered phrases were accurately translated .
knowing this correspondence between foreign phrases and their english counterparts allowed us to directly analyze whether translations that were being produced from
we produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora : a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities , and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities .
