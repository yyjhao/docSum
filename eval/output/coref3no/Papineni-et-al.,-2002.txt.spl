it is clear that a program can rank candidate 1 higher than candidate 2 simply by comparing n - gram matches between each candidate translation and the reference translations .
these five systems two humans and
table 1 shows the bleu scores of the 5 systems against two references on this test corpus .
note that the numbers in table 1 are the bleu metric on an aggregate of 500 sentences , but the means in table 2 are averages of the bleu metric on aggregates of 25 sentences .
to account for the intrinsic difference between judges and the sentences , we compared each judges rating for a sentence across systems .
the figure also highlights the relatively large gap between mt systems and human translators .8 in addition , we surmise that the bilingual group was very forgiving in judging h1 relative to h2 because the monolingual group found a rather large difference in the fluency of their translations .
