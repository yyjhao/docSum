where f -LRB- p -RRB- denotes a function from pronouns to their antecedents : f -LRB- p -RRB- = arg mcax p -LRB- a -LRB- p -RRB- = alp , h , , t , 1 , s p , ci , la -RRB- where a -LRB- p -RRB- is a random variable denoting the referent of the pronoun p and
once we have the trees in the proper form -LRB- to the degree this is possible -RRB- we run hobbs ' algorithm repeatedly for each pronoun until it has proposed n -LRB- = 15 in our experiment -RRB- candidates .
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
the impact of this probability can be seen more clearly from another experiment in which we tested the program -LRB- using just hobbs distance and gender information -RRB- on the training data .
we present two very simple methods for finding referent \/ pronoun pairs , and also give an application of a salience statistic that can indicate how confident we should be about the predictions the method makes .
