for instance , to decide whether the two representations of bob co-refer in figure 1 -LRB- b -RRB- , among other factors the proposed technique will analyze various paths that exist between the two representations for bob in the graph and measure the connection strength that those paths carry .
more specifically , the approach relies on the notion of the connection strength c -LRB- u , v -RRB- between two nodes u and v in the graph g. the connection strength between u and v reflects how strongly u and v are connected to each other via paths that exist between them .
then , for any two nodes u and v we can characterize the connections among them with a path - type count vector tuv = -LRB- c1 , c2 , ... , cn -RRB- , where each ci is the number of paths of type ti that exist between u and v. the difference among the existing cs models is -LRB- a -RRB- in the way they classify paths into types , and -LRB- b -RRB- in the way they assign weights to path types , where both -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- are either already given and fixed or , alternatively , decided by the algorithm designer based on what is intuitively reasonable
we compare our approach with these two and the results are presented in table 2 .
