section 2 describes the methods by which nero addresses its goals - deriving a document specific ontology for nes -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- ; identifying sequences of words that are normally capitalized in the document -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- ; and then classifying normally capitalized words with respect to the derived typology -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
in section 3 , the small corpus used to test the system is described and in section 4 the resulting evaluation is reported .
use of the internet , rather then the documents in which nes appear , as the source of potential hypernyms is justified because the documents used to test the nero system in the present study are rather small , and the four patterns shown in figure 1 are used very rarely within them .
features appearing in the vectors include positional information , the proportion of times the word is capitalized in the document , the proportion of times the word is sentence initial in the document and in the bnc -LRB- burnard 95 -RRB- , whether the instance appears in a gazetteer of person names or , following -LRB- mikheev 00 -RRB- , in a list of the
it includes automatic components for derivation of a typology of nes -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- , for normalisation of capitalized words -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- , and for classification of nes in a given document -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
