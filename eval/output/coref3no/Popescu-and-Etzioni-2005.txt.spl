this paper focuses on the first 3 review mining subtasks and our contributions are as follows : we introduce opine , a review-mining system whose novel components include the use of relaxation labeling to find the semantic orientation of words in the context of given product features and sentences .
in order to evaluate the impact of using web pmi statistics , we assess opines features first on reviews -LRB- op \/ r -RRB- and then on reviews in conjunction with the web -LRB- the corresponding methods are hu + a \/ r + w and opine -RRB- .
we restate this task as follows : task given a set of semantic orientation -LRB- so -RRB- labels -LRB- -LCB- positive , negative , neutral -RCB- -RRB- , a set of reviews and a set of tuples -LRB- w , f , s -RRB- , where w is a potential opinion word associated with feature f in sentence s , assign a so label to each tuple -LRB- w , f
relaxation labeling is an unsupervised classification technique which takes as input : a set of objects -LRB- e.g. , words -RRB- , a set of labels -LRB- e.g. , so labels -RRB- , initial probabilities for each objects possible labels , the definition of an object os neighborhood -LRB- a set of other objects which influence the choice of os label -RRB- , the definition of neighborhood features , the definition of a supportfunction for an object label .
