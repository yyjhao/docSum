the uri process consists of three main stages : -LRB- 1 -RRB- feature extraction representing the candidates as vectors in some feature space , -LRB- 2 -RRB- clustering of vectors , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- pruning of the resulting clusters .
we extend this similarity to similarity between candidates by defining their representation as follows : for similarity between two vectors in the feature space we use the common cosine measure which ignores the relative lengths of vectors .
we test and compare two common general-purpose clustering algorithms in our experiments : the hierarchical agglomerative clustering -LRB- hac -RRB- algorithm , and the partitioning k-means algorithm .
in our experiments we surprisingly found that the single linkage hac not only outperforms both the hac with other linkage types and the k-means , but also has a natural stopping criterion : stop merging the clusters when the average similarity between the datapoints of the clusters being merged becomes smaller than ^ times the maximal similarity between them , where ^ &lt; 1 is a constant , for which we use 1 \/ 2 .
thus , the garbage cluster is treated differently in two ways : first , the definition
in table 5 we show further details for several top clusters : we list two candidate pairs -LRB- alphabetically first -RRB- placed into the cluster , and a single context -LRB- chronologically first -RRB- extracted for each listed candidate .
