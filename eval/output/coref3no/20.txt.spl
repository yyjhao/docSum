real searchers are unlikely to use add a consecutive set of expansion terms , i.e. the top 3 , 6 , 10 or 20 terms suggested by the system .
this meant excluding some queries from each test collection ; those queries for which there are no relevant documents , queries where no relevant documents were retrieved in the top 25 documents -LRB- as no expansion terms could be formed without at least one relevant document -RRB- , and queries where all the relevant documents are found within the top 25 retrieved documents -LRB- as query expansion will not cause a
in our experiments we used the wpq method of ranking terms for query expansion , -LSB- 13 -RSB- , as this has been shown to give good results for both aqe and iqe -LSB- 4 -RSB- .
finally , in row 7 of table 3 , we show the effect if a user was consistently making the worst iqe decisions possible , i.e. always choosing the combination of expansion terms that gave the lowest average precision of all possible decisions .
the comparison was done in three ways ; first we compare how good the subjects are at detecting good expansion terms , section 5.3.2.1 , how good the subjects are at eliminating poor expansion terms , section 5.3.2.2 , and examine the decisions made by the subjects , section 5.3.2.3 .
