then we address the issue of selecting scaling factors by presenting our optimisation procedure in section 3 and a comparison with manual scaling in section 4 .
this application was chosen because the proposed method for automatic derivation of scaling factors requires a corpus of sentences that are representative of the sublanguage together with some independent measure of the correctness or plausibility of analyses of these sentences , and we had access to a hand-parsed sub-collection of the atis corpus built as part of the university of pennsylvania '' treebank '' project .
when we first implemented a disambiguation mechanism of the kind described above , an initial set of scaling factors was chosen by hand according to knowledge of how the particular raw preference functions were computed and introspection about the ' strength ' of the functions as indicators of preference .
one source of variation in the data that we want to ignore in order to derive scaling factors appropriate for selecting qlfs is the fact that preference function values for an analysis often
from these five functions on triples we define five semantic collocation preference functions applied to qlfs , in each case by averaging over the result of applying the function to each triple derived from a qlf .
