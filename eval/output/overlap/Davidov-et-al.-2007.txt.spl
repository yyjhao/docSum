given a large corpus -LRB- such as the web -RRB- and two or more examples of some concept x , automatically generate examples of one or more relations r c x x y , where y is some concept and r is some binary relationship between elements of x and elements of y. studying relationships between tagged named entities , -LRB- hasegawa et al , 2004 ; hassan et al , 2006 -RRB- proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given -LRB- or semi-automatically extracted -RRB- sets of pairs into several clusters , where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type .
the first step is to take the seed , which might consist of as few as two concept words , and generate many -LRB- ideally , all , when the concept is a closed set of words -RRB- members of the
other words in the class can thus be generated by searching a sub-corpus of documents including at least two concept words for those words x that appear in a sufficient number of instances of both the patterns 5ihx and xh5i , where 5i is a word in the class .
finally , we delete all relations in which all concept words are related to most target words and all relations in which the concept words and the target words are identical .
