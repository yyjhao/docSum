the ccg parser produces head-dependency relations , so evaluating the parser should simply be a matter of converting the ccg dependencies into those in depbank .
and third , we provide the first evaluation of a wide - coverage ccg parser outside of ccgbank , obtaining impressive results on depbank and outperforming the rasp parser -LRB- briscoe et al. , 2006 -RRB- by over 5 % overall and on the majority of dependency types .
kaplan et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- compare the collins -LRB- 2003 -RRB- parser with the parc lfg parser by mapping lfg f - structures and penn treebank parses into depbank dependencies , claiming that the lfg parser is considerably more accurate with only a slight reduction in speed .
we chose this resource for the following reasons : it is publicly available , allowing other researchers to compare against our results ; the grs making up the annotation share some similarities with the predicate - argument dependencies output by the ccg parser ; and we can directly compare our parser against a non-ccg parser , namely the rasp parser .
the overall f-score for the ccg parser , 81.86 % , is only 3 points below that for ccgbank , which provides an upper bound for the ccg parser -LRB- given the conversion process being used -RRB- .
despite the difficulties , we have given the first evaluation of a ccg parser outside
