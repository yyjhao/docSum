we perform model building using two different model builders : we use paradox to find the size of the domain , and then use mace to construct a minimal model giving that domain size .
testentazled contains 29 examples , of which 19 proofs were found without background knowledge and 10 with background knowledge proofs
put differently , the domain size for t + h would equal the domain size of t. in contrast , if t does not entail h , h normally introduce some new information -LRB- except when it contains negated information -RRB- , and this will be reflected in the domain size of t + h , which then is larger than the domain size of t. it turns out that this difference between the domain sizes is a useful way of measuring the likelihood of entailment .
similarly , small domain size differences correlate with high overlap , although domain size differences also handle multi-word entities and can draw on background knowledge .
else , if there is no proof for 3 or 4 , but there is a proof for 2 , then again it is very likely that t entails h. finally , if the model size difference between the models generated for 5 and 6 is very small then it is likely that t entails h. background knowledge .
