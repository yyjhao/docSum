pronoun resolution is the important yet challenging subset of coreference resolution where a system attempts to establish coreference between a pronominal anaphor , such as a third-person pronoun like he , she , it , or they , and a preceding noun phrase
the majority of pronoun resolution approaches have thus far relied on manual intervention in the resolution process , such as using a manually-parsed corpus , or manually removing difficult non-anaphoric cases ; we follow -LRB- mitkov et al. -RRB- ' s approach -LRB- 2002 -RRB- with a fully-automatic pronoun resolution method .
we will consider our training set to consist of -LRB- p , k , c -RRB- triples : one for each pronoun , where p is the pronoun to be resolved , k is the pronouns context , and c is a candidate list containing the nouns p could potentially be resolved to .
the columns split the results into three cases : all pronouns with no exceptions ; all cases where the pronoun was found in a sentence containing no quotation marks -LRB- and therefore resembling the training data provided to em -RRB- ; and finally all pronouns excluded by the second case .
note the supervised system was not constructed to handle all pronoun cases , so non-anaphoric pronouns were removed from the test key and from the candidate lists in the test key to ensure a fair comparison .
