on the same heldout set , parameters of the stochastic disambiguation system and parameters for parsing performance were adjusted for a core and a complete version of the xle system , differing in the size of the constraint-set of the underlying grammar .
while it is relatively straightforward to convert lfg f-structures to the dependency bank format because the f-structure is effectively a dependency format , it is more difficult to transform the output trees of the model 3 collins parser in a way that fairly allocates both credits and penalties .
performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
the parser settings compared are model 3 of the collins parser adjusted to beam size 1000 , and the core and complete versions of the xle system , differing in the
clearly , both versions of the xle system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the collins parser -LRB- 12 % for the core xle system and 20 % for the complete system -RRB- at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core xle system .
