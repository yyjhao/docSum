performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
on the same heldout set , parameters of the stochastic disambiguation system and parameters for parsing performance were adjusted for a core and a complete version of the xle system , differing in the size of the constraint-set of the underlying grammar .
the xle system achieves 12 % reduction in error rate over the collins parser , that is 77.6 % f-score for the xle system versus 74.6 % for the collins parser , at a cost in parsing time of a factor of 1.49 .
the outside weight v -RRB- c of a conjunctive node is defined as the outside weight of its disjunctive mother node -LRB- s -RRB- : the outside weight of a disjunctive node is the sum of the product of the outside weight -LRB- s -RRB- of
clearly , both versions of the xle system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the collins parser -LRB- 12 % for the core xle system and 20 % for the complete system -RRB- at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core xle system .
