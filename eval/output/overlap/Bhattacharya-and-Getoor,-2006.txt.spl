the generative process in our model may be viewed as an extension of the dirichlet process mixture model : the group labels in our model influence the choice of entities for each author reference in a paper .
the first term is the probability of group t in document di , the second
the sampling algorithm now also samples the author attributes vi iteratively , conditioned on the references and current author assignments , along with sampling the group and entity labels for each reference .
instead , in our algorithm we restrict the space of candidates such that the cluster of references assigned to a particular author label may -LRB- a -RRB- merge with a cluster currently assigned to another author label , -LRB- b -RRB- stay unchanged or -LRB- c -RRB- split and have a part assigned to a hitherto unassigned author label j ' .
similarly , when 0 = 0 , a reference has to pick a group label from other references to the same author , and also an author label from other references with the same group label .
however , if s is the cluster of references with author level j , then cat -LRB- ^ s -RRB- jt will be 0 for all group labels t , since there are no references outside cluster s with author label j .
