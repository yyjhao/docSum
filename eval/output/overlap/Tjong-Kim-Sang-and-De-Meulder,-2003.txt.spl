the shared task organizers were especially interested in approaches that made use of resources other than the supplied training data , for example gazetteers and unannotated data .
in this section we discuss the sources of the data that were used in this shared task , the preprocessing steps we have performed on the data , the format of the data and the method that was used for evaluating the participating systems .
the split between development data and test data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the test data .
named entity tagging of english and german training
table 3 : main features used by the the sixteen systems that participated in the conll-2003 shared task sorted by performance on the english test data .
this information included gazetteers and unannotated data , and there was one participant who used the output of externally trained named entity recognition systems .
one participating team has used externally trained named entity recognition systems for english as a part in a combined system -LRB- florian et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
generally the systems that only used gazetteers seem to gain more than systems that have used unannotated data for other purposes than obtaining capitalization information .
sixteen systems have processed english and german named entity data .
