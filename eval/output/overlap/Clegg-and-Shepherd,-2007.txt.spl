the software packages used in our evaluation are the bikel parser -LSB- 15 -RSB- , the collins parser -LSB- 16 -RSB- , the stanford parser -LSB- 17,18 -RSB- and the charniak parser -LSB- 19 -RSB- including a modified version known herein as the charniak-lease parser -LSB- 20 -RSB- .
that said , there is more information in a constituent tree than in its dependency equivalent , and there are many algorithms that make use of the richness of trees in order to tackle such problems as pronoun resolution -LSB- 25 -RSB- , labeling phrases with semantic roles such as cause , experiencer , result or instrument -LSB- 26 -RSB- , automatic document summarisation -LSB- 27 -RSB- , unsupervised lexicon acquisition -LSB- 28 -RSB- , and the assignment of functional category tags like temporal , manner , location or purpose to phrases -LSB- 29 -RSB- .
the stanford parser has been used to provide syntactic clues for identifying key clinical terms in the medical domain -LSB- 34 -RSB- and gene and protein names in the biological domain -LSB- 35 -RSB- , although we disagree with the latter paper
the stanford algorithm provides a de facto standard for comparing a variety of constituent parsers and treebanks at the dependency level ; if the dependency parser community were to adopt the same set of grammatical relations as standard , then native dependency parsers could be compared to constituent parsers and to biological treebanks fairly and transparently .
