the software packages used in our evaluation are the bikel parser -LSB- 15 -RSB- , the collins parser -LSB- 16 -RSB- , the stanford parser -LSB- 17,18 -RSB- and the charniak parser -LSB- 19 -RSB- including a modified version known herein as the charniak-lease parser -LSB- 20 -RSB- .
an interesting comparison can be drawn here between the charniak-lease parser , for which just over 20 % of the missing dependencies connect to at least one incorrectly-tagged word , and the original charniak parser , which uses a pos-tagging component trained on newspaper english , and for which
the stanford algorithm provides a de facto standard for comparing a variety of constituent parsers and treebanks at the dependency level ; if the dependency parser community were to adopt the same set of grammatical relations as standard , then native dependency parsers could be compared to constituent parsers and to biological treebanks fairly and transparently .
the charniak and charniak-lease parsers perform pos-tagging internally , but the difference between them is that while the original charniak parser learns to pos-tag as part of the parsing engine 's training process and therefore is distributed with a general-english pos-tagging vocabulary learned from the penn treebank the charniak-lease parser has a decoupled pos-tagging module which can be trained separately , and is provided pre-trained on a different part of the genia corpus from that which is included in the genia treebank .
