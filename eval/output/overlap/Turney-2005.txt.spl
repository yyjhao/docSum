let r1 be the semantic relation between a pair of words , a and b , and let r2 be the semantic relation between another pair , c and d. we wish to measure the relational similarity between r1 and r2 .
lra proceeds as follows : find alternates : for each word pair a : b in the input set , look in the thesaurus for the top num _ sim words -LRB- in the following experiments , num _ sim = 10 -RRB- that are most similar to a. for each a ^ that is similar to a , make a new word pair a ^ : b. likewise , look for the top num _ sim words that are most similar to b , and for each b ^ , make a new word pair a : b ^ .
for each pair a : b , create a row for a : b and another row for b : a. this will make the matrix more symmetrical , reflecting our knowledge that the relational similarity between a : b and c : d should be the same as the relational similarity between b : a and d : c. -LRB- mason is to stone as carpenter is to wood .
calculate relational similarity : the relational similarity between a : b and c : d is the average of the cosines , among the -LRB- num _ filter + 1 -RRB- 2 cosines from step 11
