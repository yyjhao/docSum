so if the portions of each sentence in the articles share several comparable nes , they are likely to be expressing the same meaning ; in other words , they are paraphrases .
we apply these obtained patterns to the articles itself , and then find paraphrases only among those which matches to any of patterns .
first we obtain pairs of articles of a certain domain from two newspapers , as a source of both ie patterns and paraphrases .
these patterns are
if each ie pattern attached to the sentences shares the same number of comparable nes , link the two patterns as paraphrases .
after dropping the patterns which appear only once , we got 725 patterns and 157 patterns respectively .
then we ran the paraphrase acquisition system for each pair or articles , and finally got total 136 pairs of paraphrases -LRB- a link between two ie patterns -RRB- .
the number of article pairs , obtained ie patterns and obtained paraphrases pairs are shown in table 4 .
we take only patterns which form a cluster and drop single-element patterns which do not have a paraphrase among the patterns .
since our method only considers the nes contained in these patterns , a wrong pair of patterns can be regarded as paraphrases in this domain .
