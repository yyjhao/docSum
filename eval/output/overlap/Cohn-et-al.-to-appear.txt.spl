our annotators -LRB- two linguistics graduates -RRB- were given pairs of sentences and asked to show which parts of these were in correspondence by aligning them on a word-byword basis .7 our definition of alignment was fairly general -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : given a source string x = x1 , ... , xn and a target string y = y1 , ... , ym , an alignment a between two word strings is the subset of the cartesian product of
these include phrase pairs whose words are aligned to each other or nothing , but not to words outside the phrase boundaries .10 the phrase extraction heuristic creates masses of phrase pairs , many of which are of dubious quality .
our phrase extraction procedure distinguishes between two types of phrase pairs : atomic , that is , the smallest possible phrase pairs , and composite , which can be created by combining smaller phrase pairs .
we compute recall , precision , and f1 over the phrase pairs extracted from the word alignments as follows : validity of phrase pairs according to the phrase extraction heuristic .
the phrase extraction heuristic allows each contiguous span in a sentence to be aligned to either zero or one span in the other sentence ; that is , nominating a phrase pair precludes the choice of many other possible phrase pairs .
