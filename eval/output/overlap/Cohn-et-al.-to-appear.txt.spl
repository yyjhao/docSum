ideally , we would like to measure agreement over the set of phrase
we compute recall , precision , and f1 over the phrase pairs extracted from the word alignments as follows : validity of phrase pairs according to the phrase extraction heuristic .
our phrase extraction procedure distinguishes between two types of phrase pairs : atomic , that is , the smallest possible phrase pairs , and composite , which can be created by combining smaller phrase pairs .
the phrase extraction heuristic allows each contiguous span in a sentence to be aligned to either zero or one span in the other sentence ; that is , nominating a phrase pair precludes the choice of many other possible phrase pairs .
the quality of an alignment a -LRB- defined in equation -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- compared to reference alignment b can be then computed using standard recall , precision , and f1 measures -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : to give an example , consider the sentence pairs in figure 2 , whose alignments have been produced by the two annotators a -LRB- left -RRB- and b -LRB- right -RRB- .
to evaluate this , we had two annotators review a random sample of 166 atomic phrase pairs drawn from the mtc corpus -LRB- sure -RRB- , classifying each phrase pair as correct , incorrect , or uncertain given the sentence pair as context .
