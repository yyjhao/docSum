the semeval 2007 task on semantic relations between nominals is to identify the underlying semantic relation between two nouns in the context of a sentence .
we selected a list of 18 lexico-syntactic and semantic features split here into three sets : feature set # 1 -LRB- core features -RRB- , feature set # 2 -LRB- context features -RRB- , and the feature set # 3 -LRB- special features -RRB- .
similarly , for theme-tool , a word acting as a theme should not indicate a period of time , as in &lt; e1 &gt; the appointment &lt; \/ e1 &gt; was for more than one &lt; e2 &gt; year &lt; \/ e2 &gt; .
furthermore , we implemented and used two semantic role features which identify the semantic role of the phrase in a verb argument structure , phrase containing either e 1 -LRB- f 10 -RRB- or e2 -LRB- f 11 -RRB- .
weights 0.25 and 0.125 are given
the instrument semantic role is used for the instrument - agency relation as a boolean feature -LRB- f17 -RRB- indicating whether the argument identified as instrument in the relation -LRB- e.g. , e1 if instrumentagency -LRB- e1 , e2 -RRB- -RRB- belongs to an instrument phrase as identified by a semantic role tool , such as assert .
the syntactic attachment feature -LRB- f18 -RRB- is a feature that indicates whether the argument identified as instrument in the relation attaches to a verb or to a noun in the syntactically parsed sentence .
