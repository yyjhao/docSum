we define a phrasetable as a set of source phrases -LRB- n - grams -RRB- s ~ and their translations -LRB- m-grams -RRB- ~ t , along with associated translation probabilities p -LRB- ~ sj ~ t -RRB- and p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- .
phrase translation model probabilities are features of the form : the forward phrase probabilities p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are not used as features , but only as a filter on the set of possible translations : for each source phrase s ~ that matches some ngram in s , only the 30 top-ranked translations t ~ according to p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are retained .
each phrase pair can be thought of
we then define : c -LRB- ~ s , ~ t -RRB- as the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s ~ on the source side and t ~ on the target side ; c -LRB- ~ s -RRB- the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s ~ on the source side ; and c -LRB- ~ t -RRB- the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of t ~ on the target side .
since the contingency table with c -LRB- s , ~ t -RRB- = 1 having the greatest significance -LRB- lowest p-value -RRB- is the 1-1-1 table , using the threshold of a + e can be used to exclude all of the phrase pairs occurring exactly once -LRB- c -LRB- 9 , ~ t -RRB- = 1 -RRB- .
