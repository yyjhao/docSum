the sat college entrance exam contains multiple-choice verbal analogy questions , in which there is a word pair , a : b , and five choices .1 the task is to select the most analogous word pair , c : d , from the
in this section , we consider related work on metaphorical and analogical reasoning -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- , applications of the vector space model -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- , and research on classifying noun-modifier pairs according to their semantic relations -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
in this paper , we apply a measure of analogical similarity to classifying noun-modifier relations , but , in principle , this could work the other way around ; an algorithm for classifying noun-modifier relations could be used to solve sat-style verbal analogy problems .
the quality of a candidate analogy depends on the similarity of the semantic relation r1 between a and b to the semantic relation r2 between c and d. the relations r1 and r2 are not given to us ; the task is to infer these relations automatically .
the kinds of semantic relations that are typically tested in sat questions are not necessarily the kinds of semantic relations that typically appear in noun-modifier pairs .
contrariwise , a good algorithm for classifying semantic relations should also help to solve verbal analogies , which argues for a strong connection between recognizing analogies and classifying semantic relations .
