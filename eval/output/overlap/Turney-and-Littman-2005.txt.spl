although there has been much research on measuring the similarity of individual concepts -LRB- lesk , 1969 ; church and hanks , 1989 ; dunning , 1993 ; smadja , 1993 ; resnik , 1995 ; landauer and dumais , 1997 ; turney , 2001 ; pantel and lin , 2002 -RRB- , there has been relatively little work on measuring the similarity of semantic relationships between concepts -LRB- vanderwende , 1994 ; rosario and hearst , 2001 ; rosario et al. , 2002 ; nastase and szpakowicz , 2003 -RRB- .
in this paper , we apply a measure of analogical similarity to classifying noun-modifier relations , but , in principle , this could work the other way around ; an algorithm for classifying noun-modifier relations could be used to solve sat-style verbal analogy problems .
algorithms that have been successful for individual words -LRB- lesk , 1969 ; church and hanks , 1989 ; dunning , 1993 ; smadja , 1993 ; resnik , 1995 ; landauer and dumais , 1997 ; turney , 2001 ; pantel and lin , 2002 -RRB- will not work for semantic relations without significant modification .
the quality of a candidate analogy depends on the similarity of the semantic relation r1 between a and b to the semantic relation r2 between c and d. the relations r1 and r2 are not given to us ; the task is to infer these relations automatically .
contrariwise , a good algorithm for classifying semantic relations should also help to solve verbal analogies , which argues
