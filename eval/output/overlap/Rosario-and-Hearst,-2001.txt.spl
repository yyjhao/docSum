it turns out that the test set for relationship 7 -LRB- produces on a genetic level -RRB- is dominated by ncs containing the words alleles and mrna and that all the ncs in the training set containing these words are assigned relation label 7 .
other words in the test set for 14 are varicella which is present in the trainig set only in varicella serology labeled as attribute of clinical study , drainage which is in the training set only as location -LRB- gallbladder drainage and tract drainage -RRB- and activity -LRB- bile drainage -RRB- .
therefore , we split the data into 5 % training -LRB- 73 data points -RRB- and 95 % testing -LRB- 1587 data points -RRB- and partitioned the testing set into 4 subsets as follows -LRB- the numbers in parentheses are the numbers of points for each case -RRB- : figure 4 shows the accuracy for the mesh based - model for the the four cases of table 5 .
it is interesting to note that the accuracy for case 1 -LRB- first noun not present in the training set -RRB- is much higher than the accuracy for case 2 -LRB- second noun not present in the training set -RRB- .
the main idea is to define a set of relations that can hold between the terms and use standard
