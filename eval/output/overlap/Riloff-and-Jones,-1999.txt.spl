the heart of our approach is a mutual bootstrapping technique that learns extraction patterns from the seed words and then exploits the learned extraction patterns to identify more words that belong to the semantic category .
the heart of our approach is based on the observation that extraction patterns can generate new examples of a semantic category , which in turn can be used to identify new extraction patterns .
we preprocessed the web pages first by removing html tags and adding periods to separate independent phrases .3 autoslog generated 19,690 candidate extraction patterns from the web page training set , and 14,064 candidate extraction patterns from the terrorism training set .4 then we ran the meta-bootstrapping algorithm on three semantic categories for the web pages -LRB- locations , person titles , and companies -RRB- , and two semantic categories for the terrorism articles -LRB- locations and weapons -RRB- .
for each meta-bootstrapping iteration , we ran the mutual bootstrapping procedure -LRB- inner bootstrapping -RRB- until it produced 10 patterns that extracted at least one new np -LRB- i.e. , not currently in the semantic lexicon -RRB- .
for this experiment , we
our bootstrapping method has two advantages over previous techniques for learning information extraction dictionaries : both a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns are acquired simultaneously , and no special training resources are needed .
