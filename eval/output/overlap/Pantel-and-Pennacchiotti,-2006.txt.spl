below is a summary of the main contributions of this paper : algorithm for exploiting generic patterns : unlike previous algorithms that require significant manual work to make use of generic patterns , we propose an unsupervised web-filtering method for using generic patterns ; principled reliability measure : we propose a new measure of pattern and instance reliability which enables the use of generic patterns .
espresso addresses the desiderata as follows : performance : espresso generates balanced precision and recall relation instances by exploiting generic patterns ; minimal supervision : espresso requires as input only a small number of seed instances ; breadth : espresso works on both small and large corpora it uses web and syntactic expansions to compensate for lacks of redundancy in small corpora ; generality : espresso is amenable to a wide variety of binary relations , from classical is-a and part-of to specific ones such as reaction and succession .
the key assumption behind espresso is that in very large corpora , like the web , correct instances generated by a generic pattern will be instantiated by some reliable patterns , where reliable patterns are patterns that have high precision but often very low recall -LRB- e.g. , x consists of y for part-of relations -RRB- .
following -LRB- pantel et al. 2004 -RRB- , we define the relative recall of system a given system b
