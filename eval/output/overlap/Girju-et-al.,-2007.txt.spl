the theme of task 4 is the classification of semantic relations between simple nominals -LRB- nouns or base noun phrases -RRB- other than named entities honey bee , for example , shows an instance of the product-producer relation .
rosario and
nastase and szpakowicz -LRB- 2003 -RRB- present a two-level hierarchy for classifying noun-modifier relations in base noun phrases from general text , with 5 classes at the top and 30 classes at the bottom ; other researchers -LRB- turney and littman , 2005 ; turney , 2005 ; nastase et al. , 2006 -RRB- have used their class scheme and data set .
we distinguish four categories of systems based on the type of information used wordnet senses and \/ or google queries : wordnet = yes or wordnet = no tells us only whether a system uses the wordnet sense labels in the data sets .
a system may use wordnet internally for varied purposes , but ignore our sense labels ; such a system would be in category a or c. based on the input variation , each submitted system may have up to 4 variations a , b , c , d. table 2 presents three baselines for a relation .
the data included different types of information lexical semantic information , context , query used meant to facilitate the analysis of useful sources of information for determining the semantic relation between nominals .
