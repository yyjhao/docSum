section 2 describes the methods by which nero addresses its goals - deriving a document specific ontology for nes -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- ; identifying sequences of words that are normally capitalized in the document -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- ; and then classifying normally capitalized words with respect to the derived typology -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
use of the internet , rather then the documents in which nes appear , as the source of potential hypernyms is justified because the documents used to test the nero system in the present study are rather small , and the four patterns shown in figure 1 are used
having obtained sets of potential hypernyms for all sequences of capitalized words in the input text , the system clusters the global set of hypernyms in an attempt to find the general types of ne that appear in that document .
table 2 shows , for each file in the test corpus , the set of ne types that were manually annotated in each document -LRB- ne types -RRB- and the set of ne types derived by nero -LRB- derived typology -RRB- .
the system is evaluated with respect to its ability to identify nes using text normalisation , to derive an appropriate typology of nes for a given document , and to classify nes in line with the derived typology .
