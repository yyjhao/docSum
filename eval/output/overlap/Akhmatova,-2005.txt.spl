we use the length of a path -LRB- take overbuy has a length 2 , form-make-establish has a length 3 ; the longer the path , the less is the relatedness -RRB- ; the amount of sense of the words that is on the path between these two words -LRB- two words connected with a verb print , for example , are more close to each other , as the words connected via make , because print has only 4 senses and make has 49 -RRB- ; and the total number of different paths -LRB- the words which senses are connected through 10 different paths are more related then the words having only one connecting path , for example -RRB- .
though we compare all words similarly now , i would like to emphasize that the following method ideally should be used only for verbs and nouns derived from them , and a different one in other cases , for , intuitively , the verbs -LRB- think about decide and conclude , and the nouns decision and
after the algorithm is the following -LRB- figure 2 : otter and its input data ; and figure 4 -RRB- : if for every proposition in the hypothesis sentence there is one in the text sentence from that it could be entailed then the sentence entailment holds , otherwise the entailment does not hold .
