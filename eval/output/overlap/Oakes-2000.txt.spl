the types of conditions imposed are : positional : e.g. , prothesis must occur at the start of a word ; certain characters
the types of sound change listed by crowley , and the conditions required for their identification , are as follows : forms of deletion and insertion : aphaeresis : deletion of the initial character from word 1 ; prothesis : insertion of the initial character into word 1 ; apocope : deletion of the final character from word 1 ; apocope2 : insertion of the final character into word 1 .
u = u = u = u yields u2 , l = l = l = l yields l , u = u = u = u again yields u2 and 0 = 0 = 0 = q yields q .
in comparing the words mati , mate , mati and maot -LRB- all meaning die -RRB- , the sequences m = m = m = m and a = a = a = a yield the protophonemes m and a respectively , but 0 = 0 = 0 = o is not found in table 5 .
there is only one entry in table 5 where the first three columns are m = m = m , and that has the corresponding protophoneme m. a = a = a for the first three columns unambiguously yields the protophoneme a , while 0 = 0 = 0 yields 0 -LRB- the null character , which may be ignored -RRB- and t = t = t must yield t .
