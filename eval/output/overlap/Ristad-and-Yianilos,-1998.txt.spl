since the levenshtein
the prototype strings are drawn from the alphabet a while the observed strings are drawn from the alphabet b. next , we model the joint probability p -LRB- w , xt , yv -RRB- as a product of conditional probabilities , where the joint probability p -LRB- xt , yv | ^ -RRB- of a prototype xt and a string yv is determined by a stochastic transducer ^ , and the conditional probability p -LRB- w | xt , l -RRB- of a class w given a prototype xt is determined from the probabilities p -LRB- w , xt | l -RRB- of the labeled prototypes &lt; w , x t &gt; in the prototype dictionary l. we considered the alternate factorization p -LRB- w , xt , yv | ^ , l -RRB- = p -LRB- yv | xt , ^ -RRB- p -LRB- w , xt | l -RRB- but rejected it as being inconsistent with the main thrust of our paper , which is the automatic acquisition and use of joint probabilities on string pairs .
our seven models consist of levenshtein distance -LSB- 14 -RSB- as well as six variants resulting from our two interpretations of three models .4 our two interpretations are the stochastic edit distance -LRB- 4 -RRB- and the classic edit distance -LRB- 3 -RRB- , also called the viterbi edit distance .
first we use the stochastic transducer to define two string - edit distances : the viterbi edit distance and the stochastic edit distance .
