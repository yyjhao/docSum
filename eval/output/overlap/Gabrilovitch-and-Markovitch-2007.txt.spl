we use machine learning techniques to build a semantic interpreter that maps fragments of natural language text into a weighted sequence of wikipedia concepts ordered by their relevance to the input .
the semantic interpreter iterates over the text words , retrieves corresponding entries from the inverted index , and merges them into a weighted vector of concepts that represents the given text .
entries of this vector reflect the relevance of the corresponding concepts to text t. to compute semantic relatedness of a pair of text fragments we compare their vectors using the cosine metric .
we processed the text of these articles by removing stop words and rare words , and stemming the remaining words ; this yielded 389,202 distinct terms , which served for representing wikipedia concepts as attribute vectors .
prior work in the field pursued three main directions : comparing text fragments as bags of words in vector space -LSB- baeza-yates and ribeiro-neto , 1999 -RSB- , using
finally , even for individual words , esa provides much more sophisticated mapping of words to concepts , through the analysis of the large bodies of texts associated with concepts .
on the other hand , our approach represents each word as a weighted vector of wikipedia concepts , and semantic relatedness is then computed by comparing the two concept vectors .
