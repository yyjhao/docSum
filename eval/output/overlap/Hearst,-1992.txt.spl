however , we have identified a set of lexico-syntactic patterns , including the one shown in -LRB- 1a -RRB- above , that indicate the hyponymy relation and that satisfy the following desiderata : item -LRB- i -RRB- indicates that the pattern will result in the discovery of many instances of the relation , item -LRB- ii -RRB- that the information extracted will not be erroneous , and item -LRB- iii -RRB- that making use of the pattern does not require the tools that it is intended to help build .
below is a list of lexico-syntactic patterns that indicate the hyponymy relation , followed by illustrative sentence fragments and the predicates that can
initially we discovered patterns -LRB- 1 -RRB- - -LRB- 3 -RRB- by observation , looking through text and noticing the patterns and the relationships they indicate , in order to find new patterns automatically , we sketch the following procedure : decide on a lexical relation , 11 , that is of interest , e.g. , '' group \/ member '' -LRB- in our formulation this is a subset of the hyponymy relation -RRB- .
when the set of 152 grolier ' s relations was looked up in wordnet , 180 out of the 226 unique words involved in the relations actually existed in the hierarchy , and 61 out of the 106 feasible relations -LRB- i.e. , relations in which both terms were already registered in word - net -RRB- were found .
