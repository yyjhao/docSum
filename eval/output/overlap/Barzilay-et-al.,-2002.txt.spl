our experiments also show that although there is no single ideal ordering of information , ordering is not an unconstrained problem ; the number of good orderings for a given text is limited .
given that there are multiple possible orderings , a corpus providing one ordering for each set of information does not allow us to differentiate between sentences which must be together and sentences which happen to be together .
our evaluation of plausible strategies measured the usefulness of a chronological ordering algorithm used in previous summarization systems
to actually identify a possible impact of ordering on comprehension , we selected only summaries where humans judged the ordering as poor .3 for each summary , we manually reordered the sentences generated by the summarizer , using the input articles as a reference .
in this summary , the three sentences related to the fact that the subject had a sex-change operation are grouped together , while in the one produced by the majority ordering algorithm , they are scattered throughout the summary .
the blocks identified by clustering are : sentences b , d , g and i ; sentences a and j ; sentences c and f ; and sentences e and h. we observed that all the blocks in the experiment correspond to clusters of topically related sentences .
