researchers have already investigated issues such as identifying repetitions or contradictions across input documents and determining which information is salient enough to include in the summary -LRB- barzilay , mckeown , &amp; elhadad , 1999 ; carbonell &amp; goldstein , 1998 ; elhadad &amp; mckeown , 2001 ; mani &amp; bloedorn , 1997 ; mckeown , klavans , hatzivassiloglou , barzilay , &amp; eskin , 1999 ; radev &amp; mckeown , 1998 ; white , korelsky , cardie , ng , pierce , &amp; wagstaff , 2001 -RRB- .
our experiments also show that although there is no single ideal ordering of information , ordering is not an unconstrained problem ; the number of good orderings for a given text
given that there are multiple possible orderings , a corpus providing one ordering for each set of information does not allow us to differentiate between sentences which must be together and sentences which happen to be together .
to actually identify a possible impact of ordering on comprehension , we selected only summaries where humans judged the ordering as poor .3 for each summary , we manually reordered the sentences generated by the summarizer , using the input articles as a reference .
the blocks identified by clustering are : sentences b , d , g and i ; sentences a and j ; sentences c and f ; and sentences e and h. we observed that all the blocks in the experiment correspond to clusters of topically related sentences .
