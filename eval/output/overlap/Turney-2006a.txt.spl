in a widely cited paper , hearst -LRB- 1992 -RRB- showed that the lexico-syntactic pattern y such as the x can be used to mine large text corpora for word pairs x : y in which x is a hyponym -LRB- type -RRB- of y. for example , if we search in a large corpus using the pattern y such as the x and we find the string bird such as the
for example , the phrase carpenter nails the wood yields the patterns x nails the y , x nails \* y , x \* the y , and x \* \* y. do not allow duplicate patterns in a list , but note the number of times a pattern is generated for each word pair xi : yi in each order -LRB- xi first and yi last or vice versa -RRB- .
for each unique pattern of the form x ... y from step 2 , create a column for the original pattern x ... y and another column for the same pattern with x and y swapped , y ... x. step 2 can generate millions of distinct patterns .
for example , ostrich : bird generates 516 patterns of the form x ... y and 452 patterns of the form y ... x. since there are more patterns of the form x ... y , there is a slight bias towards these patterns .
