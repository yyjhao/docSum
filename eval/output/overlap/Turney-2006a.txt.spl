as far as we know , our algorithm is the first unsupervised learning algorithm that can find patterns for semantic relations , given only a large corpus -LRB- e.g. , in our experiments , about 5 x 1010 words -RRB- and a moderately sized set of word pairs -LRB- e.g. , 600 or more pairs in the experiments -RRB- , such that the members of each pair appear together frequently in short phrases in the corpus .
since any two
for example , the phrase carpenter nails the wood yields the patterns x nails the y , x nails \* y , x \* the y , and x \* \* y. do not allow duplicate patterns in a list , but note the number of times a pattern is generated for each word pair xi : yi in each order -LRB- xi first and yi last or vice versa -RRB- .
turney -LRB- 2005 -RRB- limited the matrix to 8,000 columns , but a larger pool of patterns is better for our purposes , since it increases the likelihood of finding good patterns for expressing the semantic relations of a given word pair .
for the tf-idf methods in table 4 , f is the pattern frequency , n is the pair frequency , f is the maximum f for all patterns for the given word pair , and n is the total number of word pairs .
