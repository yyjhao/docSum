so , the purpose of image processing in image retrieval must be to enhance aspects in the image data relevant to the query and to reduce the remaining aspects .
image processing in content-based retrieval should primarily be engaged in enhancing the image information the query poses , not in describing the content of the image in its entirety .
5 interpretation and similarity when the information from images is captured in a feature set , there are two possibilities for endowing them with meaning : one derives an unilateral interpretation from the feature set , while the other one compares the feature set with the elements in a given data set on the basis of a similarity function , see fig .
while searching for a query image iq -LRB- x -RRB- among the elements of the data set of images , id -LRB- x -RRB- , knowledge of the domain will be expressed by formulating a similarity measure sq , d between the images q and d on the basis of some feature set .
query by example queries are subclassified -LSB- 184 -RSB- into query by external image example , if the query image is not in the database , versus query by internal image example .
an important obstacle to overcome before content-based image retrieval could take off was to
