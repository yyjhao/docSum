semantic similarity measures defined over snippets , have been used in query expansion -LSB- 36 -RSB- , personal name disambiguation -LSB- 4 -RSB- and community mining -LSB- 6 -RSB- .
semantic similarity measures have been used in semantic web related applications such as automatic annotation of web pages -LSB- 7 -RSB- , community mining -LSB- 23 , 19 -RSB- , and keyword extraction for inter-entity relation representation -LSB- 26 -RSB- .
semantic similarity measures are necessary for various applications in natural language processing such as word-sense disambiguation -LSB- 32 -RSB- , language modeling -LSB- 34 -RSB- , synonym extraction -LSB- 16 -RSB- , and automatic thesauri extraction -LSB- 8 -RSB- .
chen et al. , -LSB- 6 -RSB- proposed a double-checking model using text snippets returned by
one must consider the page counts not just for the query p and q , but also for the individual words p and q to assess semantic similarity between p and q. we modify four popular co-occurrence measures ; jaccard , overlap -LRB- simpson -RRB- , dice , and pmi -LRB- point-wise mutual information -RRB- , to compute semantic similarity using page counts .
we score the word pairs in miller-charles dataset using the page-count-based similarity scores defined in section 3.2 , web-based semantic similarity measures proposed in previous work -LRB- sahami -LSB- 36 -RSB- , chen -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- and the proposed method -LRB- semsim -RRB- .
disambiguating named entities is important in various applications such as information retrieval -LSB- 9 -RSB- , social network extraction -LSB- 19 , 3 , 4 -RSB- , word sense disambiguation -LRB- wsd -RRB- -LSB- 21 -RSB- , citation matching -LSB- 11 -RSB- and cross-document co-reference resolution -LSB- 28 , 10 -RSB- .
