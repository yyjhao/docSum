we refer to a pattern contained in our clusters -LRB- a pattern
unlike most previous work , our hook words are not provided in advance but selected randomly ; the goal in those papers is to discover relationships between given word pairs , while we use hook words in order to discover relationships that generally occur in the corpus .
to avoid the selection of common words as target words , and to avoid targets appearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed multiword expressions , we sort all target words in a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual information between hook and target , and drop patterns obtained from pattern instances containing the lowest and highest l percent of target words .
we merge clusters from different hook corpora using the following algorithm : we start from the smallest clusters because we expect these to be more precise ; the best patterns for semantic acquisition are those that belong to small clusters , and appear in many different clusters .
in our experiments we have used the following values -LRB- again , determined using a development set -RRB- for these parameters : fc : 1 , 000 words per million -LRB- wpm -RRB- ; fh : 100 wpm ; fb : 1.2 wpm ; n : 500 words ; w : 5 words ; l : 30 % ; 5 : 2 \/ 3 ; a : 0.1 .
