more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing variables , e.g. x buy y q x purchase y. under a syntactic representation , a template is a parsed text fragment , e.g. x s + interact md ^ with ~ n y -LRB- based on the syntactic dependency relations of the minipar parser -RRB- .
the general configuration assumed in this paper for
furthermore , we grouped template variants that are based on morphological derivations -LRB- e.g. x interact with y and x y interaction -RRB- and found that 4 groups , x interact with y , x bind to y , x associate with y and x complex with y , together with their morphological derivations , cover 45 % of the template instances .
the 1st line shows the coverage of the 119 templates learned by tease for the input template x interact with y. it is interesting to note that , though we aim to learn relevant templates for the specific domain , tease learned relevant templates also by finding anchor-sets of different domains that use the same jargon , such as particle physics .
finally , when allowing matching between a tease template and a manually annotated template , even if one is based on a morphological derivation of the other -LRB- 3rd line in table 8 -RRB- , tease recall increased further by about 30 % .
