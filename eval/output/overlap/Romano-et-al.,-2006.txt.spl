more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing variables , e.g. x buy y q x purchase y. under a syntactic representation , a template is a parsed text fragment , e.g. x s + interact md ^ with ~ n y -LRB- based on the syntactic dependency relations of the minipar parser -RRB- .
the general configuration assumed in this paper for re is based on two main elements : a list of lexical-syntactic templates which entail the relation of interest and a syntactic matcher which identifies the template occurrences in sentences .
we considered a template as covered if there is a tease output template that is equal to the manually annotated template or differs from it only by the syntactic phenomena described in section 3 or due to some parsing errors .
the 1st line shows the coverage of the 119 templates learned by tease for the input template x interact with y. it is interesting to note that , though we aim to learn relevant templates for the specific domain , tease learned relevant templates also by finding anchor-sets of different domains that use the same jargon , such as particle physics .
finally , when allowing matching between a tease template and a manually annotated template , even if one is based on a morphological
