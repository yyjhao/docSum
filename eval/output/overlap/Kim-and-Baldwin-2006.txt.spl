we interpret semantic relations relative to a fixed set of constructions involving the modifier and head noun and a set of seed verbs for each semantic relation : e.g. -LRB- the -RRB- family owns -LRB- a -RRB- car is taken as evidence for family car being an instance of the possessor relation .
section 3 details the set of nc semantic relations that is used in our research , section 4 presents an extended discussion of our approach , section 5 briefly explains the tools we use , section 6.1 describes how we gather and process the data , section 6.2 explains how we map the verbs to seed verbs , and section 7 and section 8 present the results and analysis of our approach .
the set of seed verbs -LCB- have , own , possess , belong to -RCB- are in the set of 57 seed verbs , and -LCB- acquire , grab , occupy -RCB- are added to the set of 84 seed verbs ; all correspond to the possessor relation .
the main reason is that vector is more conservative
for a given modifier and head noun , our method extracted corpus instances of the two nouns in a range of constructional contexts , and then mapped the original verbs onto seed verbs based on lexical similarity derived from wordnet : : similarity , and moby s thesaurus .
