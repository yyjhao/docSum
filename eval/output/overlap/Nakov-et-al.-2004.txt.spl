in addition to supporting advance queries over facts as just described , citation indexes can be improved by combining methods that use citances context -LRB- e.g. , mercer and di marco -LSB- 23 -RSB- -RRB- with methods that use citances content -LRB- e.g. -LSB- 7 -RSB- -RRB- .
they use the identified citances to improve summarization performance by using them as a feature when classifying candidate sentences in the citing paper , giving lower weight to citances as compared to other sentences .
in the next subsections we describe how these paraphrases are extracted from the citances and present a preliminary evaluation of the results for one set of citances .
table 1 shows that 81.82 % are labeled good or acceptable when using citances known to have paraphrases , and 69.23 % are labeled good or acceptable from the set 2 citances .
to cluster the 203 citances -LRB- we cluster all of them , not just those from set 1 , set 2 or set 3 -RRB- we use an
the cluster dataset is obtained by selecting the citances in clusters for which more than 80 % of the citances include both ngf and bim .
we have demonstrated some initial results in paraphrasing citances that discuss the same topic , but more work remains to be done to improve results , and to group similar citances together .
