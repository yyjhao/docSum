the structural paraphrases produced by our algorithm are similar to the s-rules advocated by katz and levin for question answering -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , except that our paraphrases are automatically generated .
in addition , sample sentences containing the structural paraphrases were presented as context to the judges ; structural paraphrases are difficult to comprehend without this information .
we believe that generating paraphrases at the structural level holds several key advantages over lexical paraphrases , from the capturing of long - distance relationships to the more accurate modeling of context .
6 paraphrases and question answering the ultimate goal of our work on paraphrases is to enable the development of high-precision question answering system -LRB- cf .
to relate question to answers in those examples , a system would need access to rules like the following : we believe that such rules are best formulated at the syntactic level : structural paraphrases represent a good level of generality and provide much more accurate results than keyword-based approaches .
the problems associated with keyword query expansion techniques stem from the fundamental deficiencies of bag-of-words approaches ; in short , they simply can not accurately model the semantic content of text , as illustrated by the following pairs of sentences and phrases that have the same word content , but dramatically different meaning : the above
