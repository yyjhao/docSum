we now construct our model m given the set of web pages d. let graph gls = -LRB- v , e -RRB- be the link structure graph over a set of web pages d if nodes of the graph are the web pages -LRB- v ^ d -RRB- and there exists an edge between any pair of nodes di and dj iff di and dj are linked to each other .
we applied cosine similarity with a novel variation of the tfidf term weighting function : the problem of web appearance disambiguation can be addressed within the standard clustering framework : the set of web pages d is split into m clusters , then one of the clusters is considered as containing only relevant pages while all the other clusters are irrelevant .
the main idea that lies behind the ib clustering is in constructing an assignment of data points x into clusters x that will maximize information about entities y that are interdependent with x. the information about y gained from x is represented in terms of mutual information : mutual information i -LRB- ~ x ; x -RRB- from being too large because otherwise the clustering will tend to be degenerative -LRB- each instance will form a cluster -RRB- .
it can be seen in the graph that when the
