the paraphrase probability p -LRB- e2le1 -RRB- is defined in terms of two translation model probabilities : p -LRB- fle1 -RRB- , the probability that the original english phrase e1 translates as a particular phrase f in the other language , and p -LRB- e2lf -RRB- , the probability that the candidate paraphrase e2 translates as the foreign language phrase .
the baseline model had a total of eight feature functions , hm -LRB- e , f -RRB- : a language model probability , a phrase translation probability , a reverse phrase translation probability , lexical translation probability , a reverse lexical translation probability , a word penalty , a phrase penalty , and a distortion cost .
we produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora : a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities , and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities .
for those items judged to have the same meaning as the gold standard phrases we could track how many would have contributed to a higher bleu score -LRB- that is , which of
