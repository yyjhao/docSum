the baseline model had a total of eight feature functions , hm -LRB- e , f -RRB- : a language model probability , a phrase translation probability , a reverse phrase translation probability , lexical translation probability , a reverse lexical translation probability , a word penalty , a phrase penalty , and a distortion cost .
4.2 translation with paraphrases we extracted all source language -LRB- spanish and french -RRB- phrases up to length 10 from the test and development sets which did not have translations in phrase tables that were generated for the three training corpora .
we produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora : a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities , and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities .
for those items judged to have the same meaning as the gold standard phrases we could track how many would have contributed to a higher bleu score -LRB- that is , which of them were exactly the same as the reference translation phrase , or had
