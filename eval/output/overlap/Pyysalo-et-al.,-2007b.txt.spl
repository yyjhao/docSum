to assess this choice , we develop a set of conversion rules for transforming the link grammar -LRB- lg -RRB- dependency scheme the stanford scheme and then create a version of the bioinfer corpus in the stanford scheme by applying the conversion rules and manually correcting the errors .
finally , to assess the practical value of the conversion method and of the bioinfer syntactic annotation in the stanford scheme , we compare the charniak-lease constituency parser2 -LRB- charniak and lease , 2005 -RRB- and biolg , 3 an adaptation of lg -LRB- pyysalo et al. , 2006 -RRB- , on the newly unified dataset combining the constituency-annotated genia tree - bank with the dependency-annotated bioinfer corpus .
compared to the 48 dependency types of the
in this section , we describe the lg-sf conversion as well as sf bioinfer , the bioinfer corpus syntactic annotation in the stanford scheme .
for creating the bioinfer corpus syntactic annotation in the stanford scheme , the starting point of the annotation process was the existing manual annotation of the corpus in the lg scheme to which we applied the lg-sf conversion described in section 4.1 .
we have presented a step towards unifying syntactic annotations under the stanford dependency scheme and assessed the feasibility of this unification by developing and evaluating a conversion from link grammar to the stanford scheme .
