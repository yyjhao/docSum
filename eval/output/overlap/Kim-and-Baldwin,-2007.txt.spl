our approach to the task was to : -LRB- 1 -RRB- naively treat all nominal pairs as ncs -LRB- e.g. the climate in the forest is treated as an instance of climate forest -RRB- ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- translate the individual binary classification tasks into a single multiclass classification task , in the interests of benchmarking existing sr interpretation methods over a common dataset .
for the sense collocation method , we experiment with a substitution method whereby we replace one constituent in a training nc instance by a similar word , and annotate the new instance with the same sr as the original nc .
since the sense collocations in the expanded training data have been varied through the advent of hypernyms and sister words , the number of sense collocations in the expanded training data is much greater than that of the original training data -LRB- 937 vs. 16,676 -RRB- .
fourth , we apply the constituent similarity co - training method over the consolidated training data -LRB- from both sense collocation and constituent similarity co-training -RRB- with the threshold unchanged at 0.8 .
however , since the generated training instances are more likely to contain errors , we decrement the similarity values for generated training instances by 0.2 , to prefer predictions based on the original training instances .
4.2 architecture -LRB- ii -RRB- we perform iterative co-training as described in section
