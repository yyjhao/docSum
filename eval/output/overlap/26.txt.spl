the goal of confidence estimation is to compute p -LRB- correct | q , a -RRB- , the probability of answer correctness given a question q and an answer a. a qa system can use the confidence score to decide whether or not to show the user the answer .
for answer selection , we used a hmm-based ir system -LRB- miller et al , 1999 -RRB- to first select documents that are likely to contain answers to a
such constraints include whether a numerical answer quantifies the correct noun , whether the answer is of the correct location sub-type and whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question .
the features we used are the answer type of the question , the number of matched question words in the answer context and whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question .
since for the trec2002 qa track each question can only have one answer , we chose the one with the higher confidence score if the web answer and the answer from base system are different for a question .
our confidence estimation techniques used a few simple features such as answer type , verb argument satisfaction , the number of question words matched by the answer context and answer frequency in the retrieved web pages .
