the part-whole relations in wordnet are further classified into three basic types : member-of -LRB- e.g. , uk # 1 is-member-of nato # 1 -RRB- , stuff-of -LRB- e.g. , carbon # 1 is-stuff-of coal # 1 -RRB- , and part-of -LRB- e.g. , leg # 3 is-part-of table # 2 -RRB- which includes all the other part-whole relations described in the winston , chaffin and hermann -LRB- wch -RRB- classification .
since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
for each set of unambiguous positive and negative examples at each level in the downward descent , we apply quinlan-s c4 .5 algorithm and learn classification rules of the form if x is \/ is not of a wordnet semantic class a and y is \/ is not of wordnet semantic class b , then the instance is \/ is not a part-whole relation .
the specialization of examples -LRB- leg # 2 , entity # 1 , bee # 1 , entity # 1 , yes -RRB- , -LRB- beehive # 1 , entity # 1 , bee # 1 , entity # 1 , no -RRB- , and -LRB- world # 7 , entity # 1 , bee # 1 , entity # 1 , no -RRB- with the corresponding wordnet semantic classes .
if there is no unambiguous node lu -LRB- and therefore default value du -RRB- , the default value for the first ambiguous example
