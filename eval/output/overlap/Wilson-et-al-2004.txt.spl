although the above sets of subjectivity clues were selected because of their correlation with subjective language , they are not necessarily geared to discriminate between strong and weak subjectivity , and the groupings of clues into sets were not created with strength in mind .
to adapt the clues to strength classification , we use the annotations in the training data to filter the clues and organize them into new sets based on strength .
to study the feasibility of automatically classifying clauses by their subjective strength , we conducted a suite of experiments in which a strength classifier is trained based on the features
the gold standard strength ratings of sentences and clauses are based on the individual expression annotations : the strength of a sentence or clause is defined to be the highest strength rating of any expression in that sentence or clause .
research in automatic opinion and sentiment recognition includes distinguishing subjective from objective language -LRB- yu and hatzivassiloglou , 2003 ; riloff et al. , 2003 ; riloff and wiebe , 2003 -RRB- , distinguishing positive from negative language -LRB- yu and hatzivassiloglou , 2003 ; turney and littman , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2002 ; dave et al. , 2003 ; nasukawa and yi , 2003 ; morinaga et al. , 2002 -RRB- , and recognizing particular types of attitudes -LRB- gordon et al. , 2003 ; liu et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
