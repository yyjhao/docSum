the assessor computes the pmi
it then uses a tuning set of another k positive and k negative seeds to estimate p -LRB- pmi &gt; threshl class -RRB- , p -LRB- pmi &gt; threshl class -RRB- , p -LRB- pmi &lt; threshl class -RRB- , and p -LRB- pmi &lt; threshl class -RRB- , by counting the positive and negative seeds -LRB- plus a smoothing term -RRB- that are above or below the threshold .
the query yield varies greatly depending on the predicate and the extraction method used : the query yield for learned rules tends to be lower than for rules from generic patterns ; the list extractor method , where one query can produces a hundred extractions or more , has much higher query yield than the other knowitall extraction methods .
while its generic extraction patterns are specific to english , knowitall could bootstrap its way into other languages by using the patterns to learn instances of a class -LRB- e.g. , cities in france -RRB- and then use its pattern learning module to learn extraction rules and discriminators in french , which may be particularly effective at extracting the names of french cities .
our pattern learning -LRB- pl -RRB- , subclass extraction -LRB- se -RRB- , and list extraction -LRB- le -RRB- methods greatly improve on the recall of the baseline knowitall system described in -LSB- 20 -RSB- , while maintaining precision and improving extraction rate .
