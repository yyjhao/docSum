the assessor computes the pmi between each extracted instance and multiple , automatically generated discriminator phrases associated with the class -LRB- such as x is a city for the class city -RRB- .4 for example , in order to estimate the likelihood that liege is the name of a city , the assessor might check to see if there is a high pmi between liege and phrases such as liege is a city .
the query yield varies greatly depending on the predicate and the extraction method used : the query yield for learned rules tends to be lower than for rules from generic patterns ; the list extractor method , where one query can produces a hundred extractions or more , has much higher query yield than the other knowitall extraction methods .
while its generic extraction patterns are specific to english , knowitall could bootstrap its way into other languages by using the patterns to learn instances of a class -LRB- e.g. , cities in france -RRB- and then use its pattern learning module to learn extraction rules and discriminators in french , which may be particularly effective at extracting the names of french cities .
our pattern learning -LRB- pl -RRB- , subclass extraction -LRB- se -RRB- , and list extraction -LRB- le -RRB- methods greatly improve on the recall of the baseline knowitall
