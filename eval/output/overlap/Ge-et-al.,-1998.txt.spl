where f -LRB- p -RRB- denotes a function from pronouns to their antecedents : f -LRB- p -RRB- = arg mcax p -LRB- a -LRB- p -RRB- = alp , h , , t , 1 , s p , ci , la -RRB- where a -LRB- p -RRB- is a random variable denoting the referent of the pronoun p and a is a proposed antecedent .
in the conditioning events , h is the head constituent above p , i \/ ir is the list of candidate antecedents to be considered , t is the type of phrase of the proposed antecedent -LRB- always a noun-phrase in this study -RRB- , 1 is the type of the head constituent , sp describes the syntactic structure in which p appears , cr specifies the distance of each antecedent from p and m is the number of times the referent is mentioned .
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
the probability that a referent is in a particular gender class is just the relative frequency with which
