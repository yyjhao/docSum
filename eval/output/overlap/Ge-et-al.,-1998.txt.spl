in particular , the scheme infers the gender of a referent from the gender of the pronouns that refer to it and selects referents using the pronoun anaphora program .
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
the probability that a referent is in a particular gender class is just the relative frequency with which that referent is referred to by a pronoun p that is part of that gender class .
by collating by referent and abstracting away to the gender classes of pronouns , rather than individual pronouns , we have the relative frequencies with which a given referent is referred to by pronouns of each gender class .
we would like to know , therefore , whether the pattern of pronoun references that we observe for a given referent is the result of our supposed '' hypothesis about pronoun reference '' - that is , the pronoun reference strategy we have provisionally adopted in
