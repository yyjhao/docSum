our grouping algorithm takes as an input the final confidence matrix , and it returns as output groups of the search-engine returned citations , such that the citations of each group refer to the same person .
the confidence value to merge two citations knowing that the web pages referenced by them share only one cap-word pair is 0.78 , which is less than our threshold value of 0.80.5 in the 11 groups that should have been merged for larry wilde , for example , 67 pairs from distinct groups shared only one cap-word pair .
for our link facet , we use our training set to estimate the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the urls of the citations share the same non - popular host , or the url of one citation has the same non - popular host as one of the urls on the web page referenced by the other citation , or the urls of the citations share the same non-popular host and the url of one citation has the same non-popular host as one of the urls on the web page referenced by the other citation .
we can obtain evidence about whether two citations refer to the same person by considering the similarity between web pages referenced by
