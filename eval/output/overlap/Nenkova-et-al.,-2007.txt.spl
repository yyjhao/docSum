so again , the score is the ratio between d -LRB- the sum of weights of scus expressed in the summary -RRB- and max -LRB- the optimal score of a summary of size x , -RRB- , but this time x is not the scu length of the
the x-axis on the plot shows how many summaries were used in the pyramid -LRB- and in brackets , the number of pyramids of that size that could be constructed with the nine available model summaries -RRB- and the y-axis shows the minimum -LRB- marked on the plot by a triangle -RRB- , maximum -LRB- marked by a cross -RRB- and average -LRB- marked by a square -RRB- of the summaries for a given size of pyramid .1 of the two , a has the higher score for the size 9 pyramid , and is perceivably more informative .
now , for each pair of summaries -LRB- sum1 , sum2 -RRB- , we can say whether they are roughly the same when evaluated against a pyramid of size n and we will denote this as i sum1i = = n isum2i , -LRB- scores differ by less than 0.06 for some pyramid of size n -RRB- or different -LRB- scores differ by more than 0.06 for all pyramids of size n -RRB- and we will use the notation i sum1i &lt; n isum2i if the score for sum2 is higher .
