we also replaced the anaphoric -LRB- same head -RRB- class we had in the first experiment with a broader co-referent class including all cases in which a definite description is co-referential with its antecedent , whether or not the head noun was the same : e.g. , we asked the subjects to classify as co-referent a definite
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
hawkins classifies as immediate situation uses those definite descriptions whose referent is a constituent of the immediate situation in which the use of the definite description is located , without necessarily being visible : hawkins lists then two uses of definite descriptions characteristic of situations in which the speaker appeals to the hearers knowledge of entities which exist in the non-immediate or larger situation of utteranceknowledge they share by being members of the same community , for instance .
