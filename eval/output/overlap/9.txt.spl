the traditional approach to solving the disambiguation challenge is to compare the values in attributes of two entity descriptions -LRB- references -RRB- to decide whether they co-refer -LRB- i.e. , refer to the same real-world entity -RRB- , for all pairs of entity references .
finally , the algorithm creates similarity edges between each pair of nodes that has similarity scores lower than 7 , but higher than a low-confidence threshold e. this means this pair of nodes can potentially represent the same entity but needs further analysis .
for instance , to decide whether the two representations of bob co-refer in figure 1 -LRB- b -RRB- , among other factors the proposed technique will analyze various paths that exist between the two
then , for any two nodes u and v we can characterize the connections among them with a path - type count vector tuv = -LRB- c1 , c2 , ... , cn -RRB- , where each ci is the number of paths of type ti that exist between u and v. the difference among the existing cs models is -LRB- a -RRB- in the way they classify paths into types , and -LRB- b -RRB- in the way they assign weights to path types , where both -LRB- a -RRB- and -LRB- b -RRB- are either already given and fixed or , alternatively , decided by the algorithm designer based on what is intuitively reasonable for a particular domain .
