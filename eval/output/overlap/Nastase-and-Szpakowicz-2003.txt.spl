they learn semantic relations between a noun and its modifier in a medical domain , to which the list of semantic relations and the lexical resource have been tailored .
the aim is to find rules which justify the existence of certain type of interaction between the two elements of the base np , through the analysis of information extracted from publicly available resources for a general domain , more general semantic relations , and ml methods that present an insightful look into the nature of the data .
what we look for is a set of rules to constitute the core of a semi-automatic learning system , which will use
the analysis we perform using this small set of data will reveal which relations are harder to characterize and need more data , and which of them have indicators that are easier to capture in rules .
ripper was used in experiments which had three parameters - lexical resource -LRB- possible values : wordnet1 roget 's -RRB- , misclassification costs -LRB- possible values : used \/ not used -RRB- , nominalization \/ adjectivalization information -LRB- possible values : used \/ not used -RRB- .
this learning process will assign a list of possible relations to each test example , according to the examples in the data set that are at the same distance from the test example .
