if our hypothesis holds -LRB- that ncs that fall within the same category pairs are assigned the same relation -RRB- , then if most of the ncs fall within only a few category pairs then we only need to determine which relations hold between a subset of the possible pairs .
we also analyzed 21 of the 90 cps for which the second noun was h01 -LRB- natural sciences -RRB- ; we decided to analyze this portion of the mesh hierarchy because the ncs with h01 as second noun are frequent in our collection , and because we wanted to test the hypothesis that we do indeed need to descend farther for heterogeneous parts of mesh .
finally , we analyzed three cps in category c -LRB- diseases -RRB- ; the most frequent cp in terms of the total number of non-unique ncs is c04 -LRB- neoplasms -RRB- a1 1 -LRB- cells -RRB- , with 30606 ncs ; the second cp was a10 c04 -LRB- 27520 total ncs -RRB- and the fifth most frequent , a01 c04 , with 20617 total ncs ; we analyzed these cps .
to determine the answer , we could -LRB- i -RRB- look at all the cps , give a name to the relations and merge the cps that have the same relationships ; or -LRB- ii -RRB- draw a sample of nc examples for a given
