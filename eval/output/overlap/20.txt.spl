all or some of these expansion terms can be added to the query either by the user interactive query expansion -LRB- iqe -RRB- or by the retrieval system automatic query expansion -LRB- aqe -RRB- .
this meant excluding some queries from each test collection ; those queries for which there are no relevant documents , queries where no relevant documents were retrieved in the top 25 documents -LRB- as no expansion terms could be formed without at least one relevant document -RRB- , and queries where all the relevant documents are found within the top 25 retrieved documents -LRB- as query expansion will not cause a change in retrieval effectiveness for these queries -RRB- .
good terms are those that are likely to improve the performance of a possible iqe decision -LRB- a set of expansion terms -RRB- ; neutral ones are those that generally make no difference and poor expansion terms are those that are likely to decrease the performance of a set of expansion terms .
the comparison was done in three ways ; first we compare how good the subjects are
for each subject we examine first whether the subjects can detect good expansion terms ; whether the subjects can recognize the expansion terms that are likely to be useful in combination with other expansion terms .
