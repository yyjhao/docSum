we introduce a novel approach for this problem : use paraphrases posed against
our idea is to try to uncover the relationship between the noun pairs by , in essence , rewriting or paraphrasing the noun compound in such a way as to be able to determine the predicate -LRB- s -RRB- holding between the nouns .
what is especially novel about this approach is paraphrasing noun compound semantics in terms of concrete verbs , rather than a fixed number of abstract predicates -LRB- e.g. , have , make , use -RRB- , relations -LRB- e.g. , location , instrument , agent -RRB- , or prepositions -LRB- e.g. , of , for , in -RRB- , as is traditional in the literature .
there is currently no consensus as to which set of relations should hold between nouns in a noun compound , but most existing approaches make use of a set of a small number of abstract relations , typically less than 50 .
in later work , -LSB- 9 -RSB- provide a semi-supervised approach for characterizing the relation between two nouns in a bioscience noun-noun compound based on the semantic category each of the constituent nouns belongs to .
in the case of combustion gas , the most frequent verb support , while being a good paraphrase of the noun compound , is not directly applicable to the relation assigned by -LSB- 10 -RSB- as result , but the other verbs are .
