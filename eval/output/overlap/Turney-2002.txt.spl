the third step is to assign the given review to a class , recommended or not recommended , based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases extracted from the review .
in addition to determining the direction of the phrase '' s semantic orientation -LRB- positive or negative , based on the sign of the rating -RRB- , this numerical rating also indicates the strength of the semantic orientation -LRB- based on the magnitude of the number -RRB- .
the third step is to calculate the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the given review and classify the review as recommended if the average is positive and otherwise not recommended .
a positive review could be summarized by picking out the sentence with the highest positive semantic orientation and a negative review could be summarized by extracting the sentence with the lowest negative semantic orientation .
the algorithm has three steps : -LRB- 1 -RRB- extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs , -LRB- 2 -RRB- estimate the semantic orientation of each phrase , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- classify the review based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases .
previous work on determining the semantic orientation of adjectives has used a complex algorithm that does not readily extend beyond isolated adjectives to adverbs or longer phrases -LRB- hatzivassiloglou and mckeown , 1997 -RRB- .
