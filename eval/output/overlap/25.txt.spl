given a list of pages obtained by submitting a person query to a search engine -LRB- i.e. msn in this study -RRB- , webhawk facilitates person search by re-organizing the search results in three steps : first of all , a filter removes junk pages that contain no person information .
a junk page , in the context of person search , refers to a retrieved web page , with respect to a person query , where no occurrence of the person query in the page occurs as a -LRB- part of -RRB- person name .
the candidate sets for different types of personal information are produced as follows , respectively : person name candidates are those names which are extracted by the in-house ner tool and contain query
in the figure , all data refers to all retrieved web pages including junk pages , clean data refers only to person pages and auto-cleaned data refers to the remaining web pages after applying filtering , which may include both person pages and junk pages .
either by simply providing a search option on the search interface indicting whether the search is a person search or a general search , or by providing an automatic person query identification mechanism , general search engines can integrate with webhawk easily and issue person queries to the person search engine-webhawk .
