the sample selection process is guided by the sufficient spanning features criterion -LRB- ssf -RRB- introduced in section 2.2 , to identify informative samples in the source language.an oracle capable of pairing a ne in the source language with its counterpart in the target language is then used .
once the training data has been collected , the data is analyzed to identify repeating patterns in the data which are used to focus the training process by assigning weights to features corresponding to the observed patterns .
the remainder of this section provides details about these stages ; the basic formulation of the transliteration model and the feature extraction scheme is described in section 2.1 , in section 2.2 the selective sampling process is described and finally section 2.3 explains how learning is focused by using feature weights .
the transliteration oracle is essentially a mapping between the named entities , i.e. given an ne in the source language it provides the matching ne in the target language .
in this paper we presented
another aspect investigated is using our selective sampling for adapting the learning process for data originating from different sources using the a reference set representative of the testing data , training samples , originating from a different source , can be biased towards the testing data .
