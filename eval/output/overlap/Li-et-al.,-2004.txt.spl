in this way , we convert the names in the source language , say e , into an intermediate phonemic representation p , and then convert the phonemic representation into the target language , say chinese c. in e2c transliteration , the phoneme-based approach can be formulated as p -LRB- cie -RRB- = p -LRB- cip -RRB- p -LRB- pie -RRB- and conversely we have p -LRB- ei c -RRB- = p -LRB- eip -RRB- p -LRB- pi c -RRB- for c2e back-transliteration .
in view of the close coupling of the source and target transliteration units , we propose to estimate p -LRB- e , c -RRB- by a joint source-channel model
the aligning process is just to find the alignment segmentation ^ between the two strings that maximizes the joint probability : a set of transliteration pairs that is derived from the aligning process forms a transliteration table , which is in turn used in the transliteration decoding .
for a test set w composed of v names , where each name has been aligned into a sequence of transliteration pair tokens , we can calculate the probability of test set number of aligned transliteration pair tokens in the data w. the perplexity ppp -LRB- w -RRB- of a model is the reciprocal of the average probability assigned by the model to each aligned pair in the test set w as ppp -LRB- w -RRB- = 2 h -LRB- w -RRB- .
