barzilay et al. -LRB- 2002 -RRB- address the problem of information ordering in multidocument summarization and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering -LRB- selects most frequent orders across input documents -RRB- and chronological ordering -LRB- orders facts according to publication date -RRB- do not always yield coherent summaries although the latter produces good results when the information is event - based .
while this is clearly a naive view of text coherence , our model has some notion of the types of sentences that typically go together , even though it is agnostic about the specific rhetorical relations that glue sentences into a coherent text .
the probability p -LRB- a -LRB- i , j -RRB- ia -LRB- i _ 1 , k -RRB- -RRB- is estimated as : to illustrate with an example consider the text in figure 1 which has three sentences s1 , s2 , s3 , each represented by their respective features denoted by letters .
although we don t have an explicit model of rhetorical relations and their effects on sentence ordering , we capture the lexical inter-dependencies between sentences by focusing on verbs and their precedence relationships in the corpus .
table 3 gives the average ti -LRB- t -RRB- for all 20 test texts when the following features are used : lemmatized verbs -LRB- vl -RRB- , tensed verbs -LRB- vt -RRB- , lemmatized nouns -LRB- nl -RRB- , lemmatized verbs
