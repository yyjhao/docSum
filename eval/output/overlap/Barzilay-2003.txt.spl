in this article , we present the concept of sentence fusion , a novel text-to-text generation technique which , given a set of similar sentences , produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences in the set .
instead of examining all possible ways to combine these fragments , we select a sentence in the input which contains most of the fragments and transform its parsed tree
instead , we select a combination already present in the input sentences as a basis and transform it into a fusion sentence by removing extraneous information and augmenting the fusion sentence with information from other sentences .
using the alignment-based similarity score described in section 3.1.2 , we identify the centroid by computing for each sentence the average similarity score between the sentence and the rest of the input sentences , then selecting the sentence with the highest score .
while the output of existing compression algorithms is always a substring of the original sentence , sentence fusion may generate a new sentence which is not a substring of any of the input sentences .
in this article , we have presented sentence fusion , a novel method for text-to-text generation which , given a set of similar sentences , produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences .
