in this article , we present the concept of sentence fusion , a novel text-to-text generation technique which , given a set of similar sentences , produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences in the set .
out of 100 sentence , 57 sentences produced by the algorithm combined phrases from several
instead , we select a combination already present in the input sentences as a basis and transform it into a fusion sentence by removing extraneous information and augmenting the fusion sentence with information from other sentences .
while the output of existing compression algorithms is always a substring of the original sentence , sentence fusion may generate a new sentence which is not a substring of any of the input sentences .
instead of examining all possible ways to combine these fragments , we select a sentence in the input which contains most of the fragments and transform its parsed tree into the fusion lattice by eliminating nonessential information and augmenting it with information from other input sentences .
using the alignment-based similarity score described in section 3.1.2 , we identify the centroid by computing for each sentence the average similarity score between the sentence and the rest of the input sentences , then selecting the sentence with the highest score .
