we have implemented a logic prover , called cogex -LRB- from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate -RRB- which uniformly codifies the question and answer text , as well as world knowledge resources , in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers .
in addition to the logic representations of questions and candidate answers , the qa logic prover needs world knowledge axioms to link question concepts to answer concepts .
lexical chains improve the performance of question answering systems in two ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- increase the document retrieval recall and -LRB- 2 -RRB- improve the answer extraction by providing the much needed world knowledge axioms that link question keywords with answers concepts .
the axioms that are placed in the sos are the candidate answers , the question negated -LRB- to invoke
a careful analysis indicates that the qa system without logic prover answered 317 questions and the prover can answer only 98 additional questions for which the system without prover failed .
however , the implementation of a qa logic prover is expensive as it requires logic representation of text , world knowledge axioms and a large number of linguistic axioms , that all take time to develop .
