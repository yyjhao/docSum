we are interested in models that can perform three tasks : modeling the joint distribution of an image and its caption , modeling the conditional distribution of words given an image , and modeling the conditional distribution of words given a particular region of an image .
the resulting joint distribution on image regions , caption words , and latent variables is given as follows : as in the simpler lda model , it is intractable to compute the conditional distributions of latent variables given observed data under this joint distribution , but efficient variational inference methods are available to compute approximations to these conditionals -LRB- see -LSB- 2 -RSB- for details -RRB- .
the independence assumptions of the corr-lda model are a compromise between the extreme correspondence enforced by the gm-mixture model , where the entire image and caption are conditional on the same factor , and the lack of correspondence in the gm-lda model , where the image regions and caption words can conceivably be conditional on two disparate sets of factors .
under the corr-lda model , the regions of the image can be conditional on any ensemble of factors but the
in the setting of image \/ caption data , we have shown that this model can achieve a competitive joint likelihood and superior conditional distribution of words given an image .
