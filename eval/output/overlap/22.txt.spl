potential applications of social networks in information systems are presented in -LSB- 43 -RSB- : examples include viral marketing through social networks -LRB- also see -LSB- 24 -RSB- -RRB- and e-mail filtering based on social networks .
in the context of the semantic web , social networks are crucial to realize a web
in the mid-1990s , kautz and selman developed a social network extraction system from the web , called referral web -LSB- 21 -RSB- .
faloutsos et al. -LSB- 14 -RSB- obtain a social network of 15 million persons from 500 million web pages using their co - occurrence within a window of 10 words .
some particular social networks on the web have been investigated in detail : l. adamic has classified the social network at stanford and mit students , and has collected relations among students from web link structure and text information -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
several indices can measure the co-occurrence -LSB- 29 -RSB- : matching coefficient , nxny ; mutual information , log -LRB- nnxny \/ nxny -RRB- ; dice coefficient , -LRB- 2nxny -RRB- \/ -LRB- nx + ny -RRB- ; jaccard coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ nxvy -RRB- ; overlap coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ min -LRB- nx , ny -RRB- -RRB- ; and cosine , -LRB- nxny \/ v \/ nxny -RRB- ; where nx and ny denote the respective hit counts of name x and y , and nxny and nxvy denote the respective hit counts of x and y and x or y. depending on the co-occurrence measure that is used , the resultant social network varies .
