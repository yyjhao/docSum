potential applications of social networks in information systems are presented in -LSB- 43 -RSB- : examples include viral marketing through social networks -LRB- also see -LSB- 24 -RSB- -RRB- and e-mail filtering based on social networks .
in the mid-1990s , kautz and selman developed a social network extraction system from the web , called referral web -LSB- 21 -RSB- .
faloutsos et al. -LSB- 14 -RSB- obtain a social network of 15 million persons from 500 million web pages using their co - occurrence within a window of 10 words .
some particular social networks on the web have been investigated in detail : l. adamic has classified the social network at stanford and mit students , and has collected relations among students from web link structure and text information -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
the number of queries to a search engine becomes a problem when we apply extraction of a social network to a large-scale community : a network with 1000 nodes requires 500,000 queries and grows with o -LRB- n2 -RRB- , where n is the number of persons .
in this section , based on the studies of social network mining and lessons learned from polyphonet operation , we propose a novel architecture for social network extraction .
such feedback from
following that concept , we propose a new architecture to extract a social network from the web , called super social network mining .
