our model can be seen as a constrained experts model , with three experts , where the constraints
hand labeling data in the new domain is a costly enterprise , and one often wishes to be able to leverage the original , out-of-domain data when building a model for the new , in-domain data .
we apply our model to four data sets with varying degrees of divergence between the in-domain and out-of-domain data and obtain predictive accuracies higher than any of a large number of baseline systems and a second model proposed in the literature for this problem .
mixw : this model is also obtained by training a maximum entropy model on the union of the out-of-domain and in-domain data sets , but where the out-of-domain data is down - weighted so that is effectively equinumerous with the in-domain data .
as the out-of-domain data , we use the newswire and broadcast news portions of the ace 2005 training data ; as the in-domain data , we use the fisher conversations data .
onlyo : this model is obtained by training a standard maximum entropy model on the out-of-domain data , completely ignoring the in-domain data .
the prior model and the feats model perform roughly comparably , with the prior model edging out by a small margin .2 our model outperforms both the prior model and the feats model .
