the bnc-based models perform consistently worse than the web - based models with the exception of f -LRB- t , w1 -RRB- \/ t ; the best altavista model performs significantly better than the best bnc model .
furthermore , notice that for both the high and low ambiguity data sets , the
the most straightforward way of implementing this idea is in the form of a backoff scheme : if the n-gram count for an item in the corpus falls below a threshold 0 , the web is used to estimate the n-grams frequency , otherwise the corpus counts are used .8 note that this backoff scheme subsumes both a purely web-based model -LRB- 0 = 0 -RRB- and a purely corpus-based model -LRB- 0 = k , where k is the largest observed corpus count -RRB- .
for two tasks we found that a combined model outperforms a straight web model , in the sense that the combined model was significantly better than the corpus-based model or the model in the literature , while the straight web model failed to achieve a significant difference -LRB- see the asterisks in table xx -RRB- .
we also compare the web-based models against state - of-the-art models reported in the literature ; typically , these are supervised models -LRB- which use annotated training data -RRB- , or unsupervised models which rely on external resources such as taxonomies to recreate missing counts .
