while many other systems have used extracted opinion phrases in order to determine the polarity of sentences or documents , opine is the first to report its precision and
we restate this task as follows : task given a set of semantic orientation -LRB- so -RRB- labels -LRB- -LCB- positive , negative , neutral -RCB- -RRB- , a set of reviews and a set of tuples -LRB- w , f , s -RRB- , where w is a potential opinion word associated with feature f in sentence s , assign a so label to each tuple -LRB- w , f , s -RRB- .
in this section we evaluate opines performance on the following tasks : finding so labels of words in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- so label extraction -RRB- ; distinguishing between opinion and non-opinion phrases in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- opinion phrase extraction -RRB- ; finding the correct polarity of extracted opinion phrases in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- opinion phrase polarity extraction -RRB- .
in order to quantify the benefits of each of the three steps of our method for finding so labels , we also compared opine with a version which only finds so labels for words and a version which finds so labels for words in the context of given features , but doesnt take into account given sentences .
