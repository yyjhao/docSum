the indoor \/ outdoor classifier used spatial color moment features and was trained on 2541 images from database and tested on the entire set -LRB- 6931
based on the above observations , we use edge direction features -LRB- histograms and coherence vectors -RRB- for city \/ landscape classification and color features -LRB- histograms , coherence vectors , and spatial moments -RRB- in and color space for further classification of landscape images -LSB- 25 -RSB- , -LSB- 38 -RSB- , -LSB- 42 -RSB- .
the main reasons for the misclassification of outdoor images are 1 -RRB- uniform lighting on the image mostly as a result of a close-up shot and 2 -RRB- low-contrast images -LRB- several of the indoor images used in the training set were low contrast digital images and hence most low contrast outdoor images were classified as indoor scenes -RRB- .
since we have not yet developed a classifier to identify sunset , forest , and mountain images from other landscape images , in the worst case , all 70 of these images will be fed to the sunset \/ forest \/ mountain classifier and hence , degrade the overall classification accuracy .
the best classification accuracies achieved for each of the classifiers were 95.9 % for the city \/ landscape classifier -LRB- on 2716 images -RRB- and 94.6 % for the indoor \/ outdoor classifier -LRB- on 5081 images -RRB- , versus 97.0 % and 95.7 % , respectively , for the classifiers trained on the entire database .
