for a potential customer , although he \/ she can read all reviews of different products at merchant sites to mentally compare and assess the strengths and weaknesses of each product in order to decide which one to buy , it is much more convenient and less time consuming to see a visual feature-by-feature comparison of customer opinions in the reviews .
our task : in order to visually compare consumer opinions on a set of products , we need to analyze the reviews in ri of each product pi -LRB- 1 -RRB- to find all the explicit and implicit product features on which reviewers have expressed their -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- opinions , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to produce the positive opinion set and the negative opinion set for each feature .
from the list of features , we note the following : explicit features and implicit features : some features are genuine features , i.e. , &lt; photo &gt; , &lt; use &gt; , &lt; manual &gt; , &lt; option &gt; , &lt; video &gt; , &lt; battery &gt; , and &lt; software &gt; .
some post - processing is needed due to a few reasons : we only need rules that have -LSB- feature -RSB- on the
consequently , there are some patterns contain specific words for pros , e.g. , excellent &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- , great &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- , but for cons , there is no such pattern but only those patterns consisting of pos tags , e.g. , &lt; jj &gt; &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- .
