exploiting this tendency , we can collect candidate polar atoms with their tentative polarities as those adjacent to the polar clauses which have been identified by their domain-independent polar atoms in the initial lexicon .
according to the evaluation of the mt method -LRB- kanayama et al. , 2004 -RRB- , high - precision sentiment analysis had been achieved using the polar atoms and patterns , where the system never took positive sentiment for negative and vice versa , and judged positive or negative to neutral expressions in only about 10 % cases .
using the polar clauses detected by the sa system with the initial lexicon , we observed the coherent precision of domain d with lexicon l , defined as : context shows the coherency of the two types of context that we considered .
we also observed the coherent density of the domain d with the lexicon l defined as : this indicates the ratio of polar clauses that appear in the coherent context , among all of the polar clauses detected by the system .
among the located candidate polar atoms , how can we distinguish true polar atoms , which should be added to the lexicon , from fake polar atoms , which should be discarded ?
therefore we evaluated the learning results by asking human annotators to classify the
