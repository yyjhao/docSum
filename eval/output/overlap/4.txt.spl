then any subsequent document that is placed into that cluster is a candidate for labeling as on-topic for that topic , and the tracking system 's confidence score for labeling on-topic can be equated to the detection system 's confidence score for placing the document in that cluster .
by viewing the resulting system 's performance in terms of recall and number of false alarms per topic , binned by the rate at which on-topic documents appear , we observe that current topic tracking technology is likely
we begin describing the implementation of our detection and tracking systems by describing a document-document similarity function based on a symmetrized version of the okapi formula -LSB- 9 -RSB- which is at the core of both the detection system with which we start and the tracking system we will describe .
this leads us to make two observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a topic detection system well - optimized to the tdt detection task converts into a naive tracking system that does not probe the area of interest to the tdt tracking task , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in order to convert a detection system into a tracking system , it is necessary to record the scores of all documents with respect to the topical cluster , not merely those documents that are merged into it .
