we begin describing the implementation of our detection and tracking
the basic idea behind converting a detection system to a tracking system is that as each document is initially considered by the detection system , the system also notes whether it is one of the seed documents of a tracking topic .
then any subsequent document that is placed into that cluster is a candidate for labeling as on-topic for that topic , and the tracking system 's confidence score for labeling on-topic can be equated to the detection system 's confidence score for placing the document in that cluster .
it is not a conversion of a detection system into a tracking system ; it is the conversion of the output of a detection system into the output of a tracking system .
this leads us to make two observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a topic detection system well - optimized to the tdt detection task converts into a naive tracking system that does not probe the area of interest to the tdt tracking task , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in order to convert a detection system into a tracking system , it is necessary to record the scores of all documents with respect to the topical cluster , not merely those documents that are merged into it .
