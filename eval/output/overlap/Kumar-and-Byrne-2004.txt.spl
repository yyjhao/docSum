while string based metrics such as bleu , wer and per are insensitive to the syntactic structure of the translations , bitree loss is able to measure this aspect of translation
we provide this example to show how a loss function which makes use of syntactic structure from source and target parse trees , can capture properties of translations that string based loss functions are unable to measure .
this illustrates why we are interested in mbr decoders based on other loss functions : the map decoder is optimal with respect to a loss function that is very harsh .
for each sentence , we compute the error rate of the hypothesis translation with respect to the most similar reference translation under the corresponding loss function .
the mbr decoder under this loss function gives improvements under an evaluation metric based on the loss function .
we present results under the bitree loss function as an example of incorporating linguistic information into a loss function ; we have not yet measured its correlation with human assessments of translation quality .
while we have focused on developing mbr procedures for loss functions that measure various aspects of translation quality , this framework can also be used with loss functions which measure application-specific error criteria .
