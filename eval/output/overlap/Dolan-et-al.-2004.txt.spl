accordingly , the dataset encompasses many paraphrases that would have been excluded under a more stringent edit-distance threshold , for example , the following non-paraphrase pair that contain an

the best overall performance , irrespective of test data type , is achieved by the l12 training set , with an 11.58 % overall aer on the 250 sentence pair edit distance test set -LRB- 20.88 % aer for non-identical words -RRB- .
the f2 training data is probably too sparse and , with 40 % unrelated sentence pairs , too noisy to achieve equally good results ; nevertheless the gap between the results for the two training data types is dramatically narrower on the f2 test data .
the nearly comparable numbers for the two training data sets , at 13.2 % and 14.7 % respectively , suggest that the l12 training corpus provides no substantive advantage over the f2 data when tested on the more complex test data .
