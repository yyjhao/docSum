for example , defense secretary george w. smith would be a name and we would analyze it
we assume that peoples names have six -LRB- optional -RRB- components as exemplified in the following somewhat contrived example : our models make the following assumptions about personal names : all words of label l -LRB- the label number -RRB- must occur before all words of label l + 1 , with the exception of descriptors , a maximum of one word may appear for each label , every name must include either a first name or a last name , in a loose sense , honorifics and closes are closed classes , even if we do not know which words are in the classes .
thus we get the following equation : here w -LRB- i -RRB- is the ith word from n ~ assigned the label l in l ~ and jv -LRB- l -RRB- is a random variable whose value is the number of words in the name with label l .
to establish a more detailed relationship between the old and new names we compute possible correspondences between the two names , where a correspondence specifies for each word in the old name if it is retained in the new name , and if so , the word in the new name to which it corresponds .
