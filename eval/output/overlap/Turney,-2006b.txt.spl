the term semantic similarity is misleading , because it refers to a type of attributional similarity , yet relational similarity is not any less semantic than attributional similarity .
in an analogy a : b : : c : d , where there is a high degree of relational similarity between a : b and c : d , if there is also a high degree of attributional similarity between and , and between and , then a : b : : c : d is a near analogy ; otherwise , it is a far analogy .
we conclude that there are enough near analogies in the 374 sat questions for attributional similarity to perform better than
the novelty in turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; berland and charniak , 1999 -RRB- ; instead , they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words .
the single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -LRB- i.e. , it requires a training set of labeled data -RRB- , but we are using lra to measure the distance between a pair and its potential neighbors , and lra is itself determined in an unsupervised fashion -LRB- i.e. , lra does not need labeled data -RRB- .
