wikipedia mining works in our system as follows : given the word pairs i , j -LRB- king and rook for instance -RRB- we
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path - based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
both wordnet and wikipedia perform better than the google baseline , which seems to suggest that using structured knowledge sources for relatedness computation yields more accurate results .
instead of integrating a word-vector based relatedness measure with a word - net based one , our results indicate that a competitive performance can be achieved also by simply using a different knowledge base such as wikipedia .
in this paper we investigated the use of wikipedia for computing semantic relatedness measures and the application of these measures to a real-world nlp task such as coreference resolution .
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
