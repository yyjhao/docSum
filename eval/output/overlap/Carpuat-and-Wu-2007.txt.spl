in subsequent empirical studies , we have shown that smt systems perform much worse than dedicated wsd models , both supervised and unsupervised , on a senseval wsd task -LRB- carpuat and wu , 2005a -RRB- , and therefore suggest that wsd should have a role to play in state-of-the-art smt systems .
in this paper , we present first results with a new architecture that integrates a state-of-the-art wsd
furthermore , rather than using a single word based wsd approach to augment a phrase-based smt model as we did in carpuat et al. -LRB- 2006 -RRB- to improve bleu and nist scores , here the wsd training and predictions operate on full multi-word phrasal units , resulting in significantly more reliable and consistent gains as evaluted by many other translation accuracy metrics as well .
we have proposed to consistently integrate wsd models both during training , where sense definitions and sense-annotated data are automatically extracted from the word-aligned parallel corpora from smt training , and during testing , where the phrasal wsd probabilities are used by the smt system just like all the other lexical choice features .
the results reported in this paper cast new light on the wsd vs. smt debate , suggesting that a close integration of wsd and smt decisions should be incorporated in a smt model that successfully uses wsd predictions .
