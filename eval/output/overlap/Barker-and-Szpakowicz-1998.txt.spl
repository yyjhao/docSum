we have built a system for noun modifier relationship -LRB- nmr -RRB- analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases .
most of the research on
instead of memorizing complete noun phrases -LRB- or even complete subphrases -RRB- and analyses , the system reduces compound modifiers and compound heads to their own local heads and stores these reduced pairs with their assigned nmr .
a preposition is an overt indicator of the relationship between m and h -LRB- see quirk , 1985 : chapter 9 -RRB- so a correlation is more likely between the preposition and the nmr than between a given m or h and the nmr .
if the current triple has a prepositional marker not seen in any previous triple -LRB- distance 5 -RRB- , the system finds candidate nmrs in its nmr marker dictionary .
the lists of candidate nmrs consist of all those nmrs previously assigned to -LRB- m , h , mk -RRB- triples at a minimum distance from the triple under analysis .
if the minimum distance was 3 or 6 , there may be two candidate lists : lm contains the nmrs previously assigned to triples with matching m , lhwith matching h. the analyzer attempts to choose a set r of candidates to suggest to the user as the best nmrs for the current triple .
