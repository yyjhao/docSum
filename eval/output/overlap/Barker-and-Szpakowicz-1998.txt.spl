we have built a system for noun modifier relationship -LRB- nmr -RRB- analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases .
most of the research on relationships between nouns and modifiers deals with noun compounds , but these relationships also hold between nouns and adjective premodifiers or postmodifying prepositional phrases .
instead of memorizing complete noun phrases -LRB- or even complete subphrases -RRB- and analyses , the system reduces compound modifiers and compound heads to their own local heads and stores these reduced pairs with their assigned nmr .
if the current triple has a prepositional marker not seen in any previous triple -LRB- distance 5 -RRB- , the system finds candidate nmrs in its nmr marker dictionary .
if the minimum distance was 3 or 6 , there may be two candidate lists : lm contains the nmrs previously assigned to triples with matching m , lhwith matching h. the analyzer attempts to choose a set r of candidates to suggest to the user as the best nmrs for the current triple .
if there is one list l of candidate nmrs , r contains the nmr -LRB- or nmrs -RRB- that occur
in order to supply the correct nmr , or even to determine if the suggested nmr is correct , the user must be familiar with the nmr definitions .
