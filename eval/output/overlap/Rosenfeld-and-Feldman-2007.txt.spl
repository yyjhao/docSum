we compare several clustering algorithms , and several feature extraction and selection methods , evaluating them using a novel evaluation metric , which is adapted for evaluating precision-oriented uri clustering results .
our findings demonstrate : effectiveness of the single-linkage hac -LRB- hierarchical agglomerative clustering -RRB- algorithm with our novel threshold-selection technique , and its superiority over the other common clustering algorithms average - linkage hac , complete-linkage hac , and k-means even when using the best possible thresholds for the hac-s , and the best number of clusters for the k-means .
importance of using both the features that test individual entities in the candidate pairs -LRB- entity features -RRB- , and the features that relate the entities inside pairs to each other -LRB- relation features -RRB- .
however , following -LSB- 1 -RSB- , we can use a feature ranking based on the observation of -LSB- 2 -RSB- that good clustering features should improve the separability of the dataset make points that are close
in our experiments we surprisingly found that the single linkage hac not only outperforms both the hac with other linkage types and the k-means , but also has a natural stopping criterion : stop merging the clusters when the average similarity between the datapoints of the clusters being merged becomes smaller than ^ times the maximal similarity between them , where ^ &lt; 1 is a constant , for which we use 1 \/ 2 .
