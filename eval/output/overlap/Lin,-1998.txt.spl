in other words , we make the following assumption : from the above assumptions , we can proved the following theorem : similarity theorem : the similarity between a and b is measured by the ratio between the amount of information needed to state the commonality
the following are four examples of similarity calculations : the results show that , given the probability distribution in figure 1 , the similarity between excellent and good is much higher than the similarity between good and average ; the similarity between excellent and average is much higher than the similarity between good and bad .
the third similarity measure is based on our proposed definition of similarity under the assumption that the probability of a trigram occurring in a word is independent of other trigrams in the word : table 1 shows the top 10 most similar words to grandiloquent according to the above three similarity measures .
maximum similarity values : with most similarity measures , the maximum similarity is 1 , except simresnik , which have no upper bound for similarity values .
application domains : the similarity measure proposed in this paper can be applied in all the domains listed in table 6 , including the similarity of ordinal values , where none of the other similarity measures is applicable .
