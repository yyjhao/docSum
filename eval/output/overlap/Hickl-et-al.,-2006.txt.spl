four classes of features are extracted : -LRB- 1 -RRB- alignment features , which compare properties of aligned constituents , -LRB- 2 -RRB- dependency features , which compare entities and predicates using dependencies identified by a semantic parser , -LRB- 3 -RRB- paraphrase features , which determine whether passages extracted from the text and hypothesis match acquired paraphrases , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- semanticfeatures , which contrast semantic values assigned to predicates in each example sentence .
we can try to -LRB- 1 -RRB- derive linguistic information from the hypothesis-text pair , and cast the inference recognition as a classification problem ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- evaluate the probability that an entailment can exist between the hypothesis-text pair ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- represent the knowledge from the hypothesis-text pair in some representation language that can be associated with an inferential mechanism ; or -LRB- 4 -RRB- use the classical ai definition of entailment and build models of the world in which the hypothesis and the text are respectively true , and then check
three classes of features were used in the alignment classifier : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a set of statistical features -LRB- including cosine similarity , and -LRB- glickman and dagan , 2005 -RRB- s lexical entailment probability -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a set of lexico-semantic features -LRB- including wordnet similarity -LRB- pedersen et al. , 2004 -RRB- , named entity class equality , and part-of-speech equality -RRB- , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a set of string-based features -LRB- such as levenshtein edit distance and morphological stem equality -RRB- .
