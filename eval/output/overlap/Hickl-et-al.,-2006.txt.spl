we can try to -LRB- 1 -RRB- derive linguistic information from the hypothesis-text pair , and cast the inference recognition as a classification problem ; or -LRB- 2 -RRB- evaluate the probability that an entailment can exist between the hypothesis-text pair ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- represent the knowledge from the hypothesis-text pair in some representation language that can be associated with an inferential mechanism ; or -LRB- 4 -RRB- use the classical ai definition of entailment and build models of the
four classes of features are extracted : -LRB- 1 -RRB- alignment features , which compare properties of aligned constituents , -LRB- 2 -RRB- dependency features , which compare entities and predicates using dependencies identified by a semantic parser , -LRB- 3 -RRB- paraphrase features , which determine whether passages extracted from the text and hypothesis match acquired paraphrases , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- semanticfeatures , which contrast semantic values assigned to predicates in each example sentence .
three types of features were derived from the paraphrases acquired for each pair : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a single pattern match feature which fired when a paraphrase matched either the text or the hypothesis , -LRB- 2 -RRB- a both pattern match feature which fired when paraphrases matched both the text and the hypothesis , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a category match feature which fired when paraphrases could be found from the same paraphrase cluster that matched both the text and the hypothesis .
