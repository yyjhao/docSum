we used these constraints to automatically construct a log-linear regression model , which , combined with supplementary morphology rules , predicts whether two conjoined adjectives are of same or different orientation with 82 % accuracy .
we train our log-linear model on l l , -LRB- excluding links between morphologically related adjectives -RRB- , compute predictions and dissimilarities for the links in l , , and use these to classify and label the adjectives in a , .
these results are extremely significant statistically -LRB- p-value less than 10-16 -RRB- when compared with the baseline method of randomly assigning orientations to adjectives , or the baseline method of always predicting the most frequent -LRB- for types -RRB- category -LRB- 50.82 % of the adjectives in our collection are classified as negative -RRB- .
the analysis in the previous section suggests a baseline method for classifying links between adjectives : since 77.84 % of all links from conjunctions indicate same orientation , we can achieve this level of performance by always guessing that a link is of the same - orientation type .
as we noted earlier , the corpus data is eventually represented in our system as a graph , with the nodes corresponding to adjectives and the links to predictions about whether the two connected adjectives have the same or different orientation .
this process is highly accurate , but unfortunately does not apply to many
