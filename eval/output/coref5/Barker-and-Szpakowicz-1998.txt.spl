we have built a system for noun modifier relationship -LRB- nmr -RRB- analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases .
since the nmr analyzer is intended for technical texts , the restriction to transparent endocentric compounds should not limit the utility of the system .
instead
if the current triple has a prepositional marker not seen in any previous triple -LRB- distance 5 -RRB- , the system finds candidate nmrs in its nmr marker dictionary .
if the minimum distance was 3 or 6 , there may be two candidate lists : lm contains the nmrs previously assigned to triples with matching m , lhwith matching h. the analyzer attempts to choose a set r of candidates to suggest to the user as the best nmrs for the current triple .
to compensate for the lack of previous analyses , the system relies on the help of a user , who supplies the correct nmr when the system can not determine it automatically .
furthermore , if the appropriate nmr is not among those suggested by the system , the user can request the complete list of paraphrases with the current modifier and head .
since the system starts with no previous noun phrase analyses , the user is responsible for supplying nmrs at the beginning of a session .
