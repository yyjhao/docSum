we show that this model can address these problems over multi-party discourse transcripts , providing good segmentation performance on a corpus of meetings -LRB- comparable to the best previous unsupervised method that we are aware of -LRB- galley et al. , 2003 -RRB- -RRB- , while also inferring a set of topics rated as semantically coherent by human judges .
following previous work on probabilistic topic models -LRB- hofmann , 1999 ; blei et al. , 2003 ; griffiths and steyvers , 2004 -RRB- , we model each utterance as being generated from a particular distribution over topics , where each topic is a probability distribution over words .
for each set of annotations , we therefore performed two sets of segmentations : one in which the threshold was set for each meeting to give the known gold - standard number of segments , and one in which the threshold was set on a separate development set to give the overall corpus-wide average number of segments , and held constant for all test meetings .2 this also allows us to compare our results with those of -LRB- galley et al. , 2003 -RRB- , who apply a similar threshold to their lexical cohesion function and give corresponding results produced with known \/ unknown numbers of segments .
interestingly , using an even distribution of boundaries but allowing the topic model to infer topics performs similarly well
