it proposes two new methods to identify comparative sentences and to extract comparative relations from these sentences based on two new types of rules , class sequential rules and label sequential rules .
identifying gradable comparatives : nb using csrs and crf for extracting relation entries manual rules as the attribute set gave a precision of 82 % and a recall of 81 % -LRB- f-score = 81 % -RRB- for identification of gradable comparative sentences .
sequence data generation : we create a sequence database for mining as follows : since we are interested in predicting and extracting items representing entitys -RSB- -LRB- denoted by $ es -RSB- -RRB- , entitys2 -LRB- denoted by $ es2 -RRB- , and features -LRB- denoted by $ ft -RRB- , non-entity-feature -LRB- denoded by $ nef -RRB- , which are called labels , we first manually label such words in each sentence in the training data .
definition -LRB- comparative relation -RRB- : a comparative relation captures the essence of a comparative sentence and is represented with the following : -LRB- relationword , features , entitys1 , entitys2 , type -RRB- where relation word : the keyword used to express a comparative relation in a sentence .
we can see that comparative
important pos tags to this work and their categories are : nn : noun , nnp : proper noun , prp : pronoun , vbz : verb , present tense , 3rd person singular , jjr : comparative adjective , jjs : superlative adjective , rbr : comparative adverb , rbs : superlative adverb .
