we define the following two conjugate dirichlet priors for the sentiment model ^ p and ^ n , respectively : dir -LRB- -LCB- 1 + pp -LRB- wi ^ p -RRB- -RCB- wev -RRB- and dir -LRB- -LCB- 1 + np -LRB- wi ~ ^ n -RRB- -RCB- wev -RRB- , where the parameters p and
with this model , we can extract the topic \/ subtopics from blog articles , reveal the correlation of these topics and different sentiments , and further model the dynamics of each topic and its associated sentiments .
rather than directly using the learned sentiment models to analyze our target collection , we use them to define a prior on the sentiment models and estimate sentiment models -LRB- and the topic models -RRB- using the maximum a posterior estimator .
correspondingly , we introduce four multinomial distributions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- bb is a background topic model to capture common english words ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- o = -LCB- b1 , , bki are k topic models to capture neutral descriptions about k global subtopics in the collection ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- bp is a positive sentiment model to capture positive opinions ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- bn is a negative sentiment model to capture negative opinions for all the topics in the collection .
no existing topic extraction work -LSB- 9 , 1 , 16 , 15 , 17 -RSB- could extract sentiment models from text , while no sentiment classification algorithm could model a mixture of topics simultaneously .
