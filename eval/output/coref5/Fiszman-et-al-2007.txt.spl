negation in comparative
an adjective or noun is used to denote the scale , and words such as than , as , with , and to serve as cues to identify the compared terms , the scale , and the relative position of the terms on the scale .
we extracted sentences for developing comparative processing from a set of some 10,000 medline citations reporting on the results of clinical trials , a rich source of comparative structures .
the processing of comparative expressions such as -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- was incorporated into an existing system , semrep -LSB- rindflesch and fiszman , 2003 ; rindflesch et al. , 2005 -RSB- , which constructs semantic predications by mapping assertions in biomedical text to the unified medical language system -LRB- umls -RRB- -LSB- humphreys et al. , 1998 -RSB- .
although , in this paper , we tested the method on structures in which the compared terms belong to the semantic group chemicals &amp; drugs , we can straightforwardly generalize the method by adding other semantic groups to the algorithm .
we suggest one example of an application that can benefit from the information provided by the knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation of comparative structures , and that is the interpretation of outcome statements in medline citations , as a method for supporting automatic access to the latest results from clinical trials research .
