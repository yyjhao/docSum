although noun compounds are very productive allowing for a fairly large number of possible interpretations , table 3 shows that a relatively small subset of the 35 semantic relations covers most of the semantic distribution of these constructions on a large open-domain corpus .
we present empirical observations on the distribution of a core set of semantic relations in noun compounds and provide a mapping between two sets of semantic classification categories .
since we wanted to compare our approach with two state-of-the-art unsupervised probabilistic models , we selected as test sets those randomly obtained by lauer from grolier encyclopedia for each type of noun compounds : 282 nounnoun pairs for two noun compounds , and 244 three noun instances for three noun compounds .
section 2 presents the
although researchers -LRB- jespersen , 1954 ; downing , 1977 -RRB- argued that noun compounds encode an infinite set of semantic relations , many agree -LRB- levi , 1978 ; finin , 1980 -RRB- there is a limited number of relations that occur with high frequency in noun compounds .
we use two different lists of semantic target categories : the list of 35 semantic relations and the list of 8 prepositional paraphrases and compare our results with those obtained on the same test set by lauer -LRB- 1995 -RRB- and lapata and keller -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
