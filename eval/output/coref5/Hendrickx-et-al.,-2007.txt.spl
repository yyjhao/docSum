the main verb of the sentence in which the entities involved in the relation appear , as predicted by the shallow parser .
from a pool of easily computable features , we selected feature subsets for each classifier in a number of wrapper experiments , i.e. repeated cross-validation experiments on the training
the features that apply to the entities in a relation -LRB- e 1 , e2 -RRB- are extracted for term 1 -LRB- t1 -RRB- and term 2 -LRB- t2 -RRB- of the relation , where t1 is the first term in the relation name , and t2 is the second term .
we also entered a second system , which did not rely on wn but instead made use of automatically generated semantic clusters -LRB- decadt and daelemans , 2004 -RRB- to model the semantic classes of the entities .
while the features were selected independently for all relations , the seven classifiers in the wnbased system all make use of the wn semantic class features ; in the system that did not use wn , the seven classifiers make use of the cluster class features instead .
for the partwhole relation we also experimented with binary features expressing whether the two entities in the relation have some type of meronym and holonym relation , but these features did not prove to be predictive .
