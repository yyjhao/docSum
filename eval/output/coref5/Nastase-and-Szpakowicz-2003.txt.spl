we explore available lexical resources -LRB- wordnet and roget 's thesaurus -RRB- to provide the attributes , and machine learning -LRB- ml -RRB- tools to find the most salient combinations of attributes .
they learn semantic relations between a noun and its modifier in a medical domain , to which the list of semantic relations and the lexical resource have been tailored .
the aim is to find rules which justify the existence of certain type of interaction between the two elements of the base np , through the analysis of information extracted from publicly available resources for a general domain , more general semantic relations , and ml methods that present an insightful look into the nature of the data .
what we look for is a set of rules to constitute the core of a semi-automatic learning system , which will use these rules to tag other examples with semantic
the analysis we perform using this small set of data will reveal which relations are harder to characterize and need more data , and which of them have indicators that are easier to capture in rules .
c5 .0 uses the training part of the data to build a decision tree or rule set model of the data , which is then applied to the test set .
