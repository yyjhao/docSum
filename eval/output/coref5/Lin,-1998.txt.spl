since similarity is the ratio between the amount of information in the commonality and the amount of information in the description of the two objects , if we know the commonality of the two objects , their similarity tells us how much more information is needed to determine what these two objects are .
the following are four examples of similarity calculations : the results show that , given the probability distribution in figure 1 , the similarity between excellent and good is much higher than the similarity between good and average ; the similarity between excellent and average is much higher than the similarity between good and bad .
to do so , assuming that a morphological analyzer is not available , one can define a similarity measure between two strings and rank the words in the word list in descending order of their similarity to the given word .
the third similarity measure is based on our proposed definition of similarity under the assumption that the probability of a trigram occurring in a word is independent of other trigrams in the word : table 1 shows the top 10 most similar words to grandiloquent according to the above three similarity measures .
application domains : the similarity measure proposed in this paper
