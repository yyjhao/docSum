we will introduce the shallow semantic analysis -LRB- section 2 -RRB- and the deep semantic analysis -LRB- section 3 -RRB- , present the results of our two runs -LRB- section 4 -RRB- , and discuss them -LRB- section 5 -RRB- .
in addition , we use four other shallow features : textlength measuring the length of t in words , hyplength measuring the length of the hypothesis and proplength measuring the difference between textlength and h len th as textlength the last shallow feature task simply uses the task variable -LRB- one of sum , qa , ie , ir -RRB- as our results in rte-1 -LRB- bos and markert , 2005 -RRB- showed that the different tasks can need different inference methods .
we perform model building using two different model builders : we use paradox to find the size of the domain , and then use mace to construct a minimal model giving that domain size .
if vampire finds a proof for 1 , it is very likely that t entails h. if vampire finds a proof for 3 or 4 , then we are -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- dealing with inconsistent background knowledge and there is nothing we can say about the relationship between t and h -LRB- however , it could be the case that t + h is inconsistent , which would mean that t does not entail h -RRB- .
