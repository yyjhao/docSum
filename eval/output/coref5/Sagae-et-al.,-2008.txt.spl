conversion to shallow ptb trees was done by mapping tree patterns from enju 's phrase structure output into the corresponding shallow ptb tree patterns , and conversion to sd was done by first converting enju 's output to shallow ptb format , then applying the same ptb-to-sd utility used with the ptb parsers .
for example , the parc 700 dependencybank -LRB- king et al. , 2003 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of lfg parsers -LRB- kaplan et al. , 2004 ; burke et al. , 2004 -RRB- , a ccg tree - bank -LRB- ccgbank -RRB- -LRB- hockenmaier and steedman , 2002 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of ccg parsing models -LRB- hockenmaier , 2003 ; clark and curran , 2004 -RRB- , and hpsg treebanks , which were created manually -LRB- oepen et al. , 2004 -RRB- or derived from ptb data -LRB- miyao et al. , 2005 -RRB- , were used for the evaluation of hpsg parsers -LRB- toutanova et al. , 2004 ; miyao and tsujii , 2005 ; ninomiya et al. , 2007 ; sagae et al. , 2007 -RRB- .
the same sentence used as an example for gr annotation -LRB- regulators also ordered centrust to stop buying back the preferred stock -RRB- has the following representation in sd format -LRB- as
in addition , unlike in the hpsg - &gt; gr conversion , which was developed based on gold-standard sets , the sd - &gt; gr conversion was developed using the 700-sentence gr gold-standard , and the same sentences with sd annotations obtained from automatic conversion from gold-standard ptb trees .
