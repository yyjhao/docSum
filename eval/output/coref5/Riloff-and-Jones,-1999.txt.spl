the heart of our approach is a mutual bootstrapping technique that learns extraction patterns from the seed words and then exploits the learned extraction patterns to identify more words that belong to the semantic category .

in this paper , we first describe the mutual bootstrapping algorithm that generates both a semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously .
for example , an ie system to identify locations might use a semantic lexicon that lists country names and the 50 u.s. states , and then rely on extraction patterns to recognize other location phrases such as cities , neighborhoods , and general descriptions like '' downtown '' or '' northwest region '' .
we preprocessed the web pages first by removing html tags and adding periods to separate independent phrases .3 autoslog generated 19,690 candidate extraction patterns from the web page training set , and 14,064 candidate extraction patterns from the terrorism training set .4 then we ran the meta-bootstrapping algorithm on three semantic categories for the web pages -LRB- locations , person titles , and companies -RRB- , and two semantic categories for the terrorism articles -LRB- locations and weapons -RRB- .
our bootstrapping method has two advantages over previous techniques for learning information extraction dictionaries : both a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns are acquired simultaneously , and no special training resources are needed .
