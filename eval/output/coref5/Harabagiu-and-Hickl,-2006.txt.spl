we expect that the meaning of an information-seeking scenario s can be represented as a question under discussion -LRB- qud -RRB- qs , which denotes a partially-ordered set of subquestions -LRB- q e qs -RRB- that represent the entire set of questions that could potentially be asked in order to er information relevant to s. taken together , we expect these subquestions to represent the widest possible construal of a users information need given s. we believe the set of subquestions implied by qs can be used to test whether a text passage is relevant to s. since the formal answerhood relation between a question and its answer -LRB- s -RRB- can be cast in terms of -LRB- logical -RRB- entailment -LRB- groenendijk , 1999 ; lewis , 1988 -RRB- , we believe that systems for recognizing textual entailment -LRB- dagan et al. , 2005 -RRB- could be used in order to identify those text passages that should be considered when ering information related to a scenario .
annotators were tasked with evaluating three types of output from our q \/ a system : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the ranked list of passages retrieved by our systems passage retrieval module , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the list of passages identified as being ce by the scenario , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the set of answers marked as being ce by the scenario -LRB- ansset3 -RRB- .
we have explored the impact
