next , we implemented a prototype that utilizes a state-of-the-art method for learning entailment relations from the web -LRB- szpektor et al. , 2004 -RRB- , the minipar dependency parser -LRB- lin , 1998 -RRB- and a syntactic matching module .
more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing
candidate pairs that do not consist of two proteins , as tagged in the input dataset , were filtered out -LRB- see section 4.1 ; recall that our experiments were applied to the dataset of protein interactions , which isolates the re task from the protein name recognition task -RRB- .
to handle transparent head nouns , which is the only phenomenon that demonstrates domain dependence , we extracted a set of the 5 most frequent transparent head patterns in the development set , e.g. fragment of x. in order to compare -LRB- roughly -RRB- our performance with supervised methods applied to this dataset , as summarized in -LRB- bunescu et al. , 2005 -RRB- , we adopted their recall and precision measurement .
the 1st line shows the coverage of the 119 templates learned by tease for the input template x interact with y. it is interesting to note that , though we aim to learn relevant templates for the specific domain , tease learned relevant templates also by finding anchor-sets of different domains that use the same jargon , such as particle physics .
