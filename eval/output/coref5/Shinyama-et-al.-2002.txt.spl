so
for example , two expressions bush has expressed his confidence in koizumis reforms and bush and koizumi watched a demonstration of horseback archery are both found in the articles of the same day and both contain the comparable nes -LRB- bush and koizumi -RRB- , but they are not paraphrases .
we apply these obtained patterns to the articles itself , and then find paraphrases only among those which matches to any of patterns .
first we obtain pairs of articles of a certain domain from two newspapers , as a source of both ie patterns and paraphrases .
if each ie pattern attached to the sentences shares the same number of comparable nes , link the two patterns as paraphrases .
first we obtained the most relevant 300 articles from mainichi newspaper -LRB- total of 111373 articles -RRB- for two domains , arrest events and personnel affairs -LRB- hiring and firing of executives -RRB- .
then we ran the paraphrase acquisition system for each pair or articles , and finally got total 136 pairs of paraphrases -LRB- a link between two ie patterns -RRB- .
in this experiment , we linked two ie patterns as paraphrases .
since our method only considers the nes contained in these patterns , a wrong pair of patterns can be regarded as paraphrases in this domain .
