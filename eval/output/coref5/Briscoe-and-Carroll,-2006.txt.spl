the full system can be extended in a variety of ways for example , by pruning pos tags but allowing multiple tag possibilities per word as input to the parser , by incorporating lexical subcategorization into parse selection , by computing gr weights based on the proportion and probability of the n-best analyses yielding them , and so forth broadly trading accuracy and greater domain - dependence against speed and reduced sensitivity to domain-specific lexical behavior -LRB- briscoe and carroll , 2002
table 1 shows accuracy results for each individual relation and feature , starting with the gr bilexical relations in the extended depbank and followed by most depbank features reported by kaplan et al. , and finally overall macro - and mi 4.3 evaluation issues the depbank num feature on nouns is evaluated by kaplan et al. on the grounds that it is semantically-relevant for applications .
we speculate that we achieve these results because our system is engineered to make minimal use of lexical information both in the grammar and in parse ranking , because the grammar has been developed to constrain ambiguity despite this lack of lexical information , and because we can compute the full packed parse forest for all the test sentences efficiently -LRB- without sacrificing speed of processing with respect to other statistical parsers -RRB- .
