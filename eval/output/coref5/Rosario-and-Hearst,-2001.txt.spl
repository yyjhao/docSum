because the data is sparse , empirical methods that train on word occurrences alone -LRB- hindle and rooth , 1993 -RRB- have been supplanted by algorithms that generalize one or both of the nouns according to class - membership measures -LRB- resnik , 1993 ; resnik and hearst , 1993 ; brill and resnik , 1994 ; li and abe , 1998 -RRB- , but the statistics are computed for the particular preposition and verb .
for the automatic classification task , we used only the 18 relations -LRB- indicated in bold in table 1 -RRB- for which an adequate number of examples were found in the current collection .
on the other hand , if we look at relations 14 and 15 , we find a wider range
therefore , we split the data into 5 % training -LRB- 73 data points -RRB- and 95 % testing -LRB- 1587 data points -RRB- and partitioned the testing set into 4 subsets as follows -LRB- the numbers in parentheses are the numbers of points for each case -RRB- : figure 4 shows the accuracy for the mesh based - model for the the four cases of table 5 .
it is interesting to note that the accuracy for case 1 -LRB- first noun not present in the training set -RRB- is much higher than the accuracy for case 2 -LRB- second noun not present in the training set -RRB- .
