given that there are multiple possible orderings , a corpus providing one ordering for each set of information does not allow us to differentiate between sentences which must be together and sentences which happen to be together .
our evaluation of plausible strategies measured the usefulness of a chronological ordering algorithm used in previous summarization systems -LRB- mckeown et al. , 1999 ; lin &amp; hovy , 2001 -RRB- as well as an alternative , original strategy , majority ordering .
to actually identify a possible impact of ordering on comprehension , we selected only summaries where humans judged the ordering as poor .3 for each summary , we manually reordered the sentences generated by the summarizer , using the input articles as a reference .
themes are sets of sentences from different documents that contain repeated information and do not necessarily contain sentences from all the documents -LRB- see two examples of themes in figure 2 -RRB- .
for each pair of themes , thi and thy , we keep two counts , cij and cy , i ; cij is the
figure 12 shows how the augmented algorithm improves the sentence order compared with the order in the summary produced by the co algorithm in figure 9 ; sentences quoting us officials are now grouped together , and so are the descriptions of the mourning .
