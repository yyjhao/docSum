the chief contribution of this
the key difference between the standard model and our speclustering model is that our model assumes each document is generated by a mixture of two multinomials -LCB- one associated with the document s cluster , and the other shared across all clusters .
as we show below , our more elaborate speclustering model can lead to improved accuracy when used for automatic clustering , and it also provides a formalism that can easily accomodate several important types of user feedback to support mixed-initiative clustering .
the simple method inherits previous clustering results which the user gives her feedback upon and for removed clusters , we reset the initial value of p -LRB- si1di ; bt -RRB- by distributing the probability mass uniformly among all clusters and halving the probability for the cluster s. the joint method uses feedback jointly to initialize the model .
we don t put constraints on how the reviewer does the feedback , so the reviewer can make decisions freely based on how she perceives the clustering results , and gives feedback using her own interpretation of the results .
all 5 runs with cr or pp feedback , 4 runs with wx feedback and 3 runs with hx feedback outperform both naive bayes baseline and speclustering-bound without feedback .
