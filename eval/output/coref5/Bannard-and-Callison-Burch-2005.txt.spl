much previous work on extracting paraphrases -LRB- barzilay and mckeown , 2001 ; barzilay and lee , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2003 -RRB- has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted , and treated as paraphrases .
since the best paraphrase may vary depending on information about the sentence that e1 appears in , we extend the paraphrase probability to include that sentence s : word-level alignments in this paper , direct estimation of phrasal translations -LRB- marcu and wong , 2002 -RRB- would also suffice for extracting paraphrases from bilingual corpora .
we include a simple language model probability , which would additionally rank e2 based on the probability of the sentence formed by substiuting e2 for e1 in s. a possible extension which we do not evaluate might be permitting only paraphrases that are the same syntactic type as the original phrase , which we could do by extending the translation model probabilities to
we evaluated the accuracy of top ranked paraphrases when the paraphrase probability was calculated using the manual alignments , the automatic alignments , automatic alignments produced over multiple corpora in different languages , all of the above with language model re-ranking , all of the above with the candidate paraphrases limited to the same sense as the original phrase .
