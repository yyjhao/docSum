for instance , vickrey et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and specia -LRB- 2006 -RRB- proposed wsd systems designed for french to english , and portuguese to english translation respectively , and present a more optimistic outlook for the use of wsd in mt , although these wsd systems have not yet been integrated nor
in this paper , we present first results with a new architecture that integrates a state-of-the-art wsd model into phrase-based smt so as to perform multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation , and show that this new wsd approach not only produces gains across all available chinese-english iwslt06 test sets for all eight commonly used automated mt evaluation metrics , but also produces statistically significant gains on the much larger nist chinese-english task .
in subsequent empirical studies , we have shown that smt systems perform much worse than dedicated wsd models , both supervised and unsupervised , on a senseval wsd task -LRB- carpuat and wu , 2005a -RRB- , and therefore suggest that wsd should have a role to play in state-of-the-art smt systems .
we have proposed to consistently integrate wsd models both during training , where sense definitions and sense-annotated data are automatically extracted from the word-aligned parallel corpora from smt training , and during testing , where the phrasal wsd probabilities are used by the smt system just like all the other lexical choice features .
