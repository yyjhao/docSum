semantic relatedness measures are used in many applications in natural language processing -LRB- nlp -RRB- such as word sense disambiguation -LRB- patwardhan et al. , 2005 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 -RRB- , interpretation of noun compounds -LRB- kim &amp; baldwin , 2005 -RRB- and spelling correction -LRB- budanitsky &amp; hirst , 2006 -RRB- .
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path - based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
since the edge counting approach relies on a uniform modeling of the hierarchy , researchers started to develop measures for computing semantic relatedness which abstract from this problem -LRB- wu &amp; palmer , 1994 ; resnik , 1995 ; leacock &amp; chodorow , 1998 ; finkelstein et al. , 2002 ; banerjee &amp; pedersen , 2003 , inter alia -RRB- .
leacock &amp; chodorow -LRB- 1998 , lch -RRB- propose a normalized path-length measure which takes into account the depth of the taxonomy in which the concepts are found where length -LRB- c1
