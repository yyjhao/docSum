this meant excluding some queries from each test collection ; those queries for which there are no relevant documents , queries where no relevant documents were retrieved in the top 25 documents -LRB- as no expansion terms could be formed without at least one relevant document -RRB- , and queries where all the relevant documents are found within the top 25 retrieved documents -LRB- as query expansion will not cause a change in retrieval effectiveness for these queries -RRB- .
good terms are those that are likely to improve the performance of a possible iqe decision -LRB- a set of expansion terms -RRB- ; neutral ones are those that generally make no difference and poor expansion terms are those that are likely to decrease the performance of a set of expansion terms .
finally , in row 7 of table 3 , we show the effect if a user was consistently making the worst iqe decisions possible , i.e. always choosing the combination of expansion terms that gave the lowest average precision of all possible decisions .
in table 5 we compare the size of iqe decisions that lead to an increase in retrieval effectiveness -LRB- good iqe decisions , table 5 , row 4 -RRB- against those that led to a decrease in retrieval effectiveness -LRB- poor iqe decisions , table 5
