an arguably more robust strategy to account for category agreement , which also proves to be computationally efficient , is to maximize the agreement between the categories of the assigned entity to each surface form and all possible disam - biguations of the other surface forms in d. we will show that this is equivalent to computing : indeed , using the definition of d and partitioning the context and category components , we can re - write the sum
in a second stage , a hybrid named-entity recognizer based on capitalization rules , web statistics , and statistics extracted from the conll 2003 shared task data -LRB- tjong kim sang and de meulder , 2003 -RRB- identifies the boundaries of the entity mentions in the text and assigns each set of mentions sharing the same surface form a probability distribution over four labels : person , location , organization , and miscellaneous .1 the named entity recognition component resolves the structural ambiguity with regard to conjunctions -LRB- e.g. , barnes and noble , lewis and clark -RRB- , possessives -LRB- e.g. , alice 's adventures in wonderland , britain 's tony blair -RRB- , and prepositional attachment -LRB- e.g. , whitney museum of american art , whitney museum in new york -RRB- by using the surface form information extracted from wikipedia , when available , with back-off to co-occurrence counts on the web , in a similar way to lapata and keller -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
