the model is particularly relevant for multidocument summarization since it could provide an alternative to chronological ordering especially for documents where publication date information is unavailable or uninformative -LRB- e.g. , all documents have the same date -RRB- .
barzilay et al. -LRB- 2002 -RRB- address the problem of information ordering in multidocument summarization and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering -LRB- selects most frequent orders across input documents -RRB- and chronological ordering -LRB- orders facts according to publication date -RRB- do not always yield coherent summaries although the latter produces good results when the information is event - based .
sentences are represented by a set of informative features -LRB- e.g. , a verb and its subject , a noun and its modifier -RRB- that can be automatically extracted from the corpus without recourse to manual annotation .
although we don t have an explicit model of rhetorical relations and their effects on sentence ordering , we capture the lexical inter-dependencies between sentences by focusing on verbs and their precedence relationships in the corpus .
while this is clearly a naive view of text coherence , our model has some notion of the types of sentences that typically go together , even though it is agnostic about the specific rhetorical relations that glue sentences into a coherent text .
first we calculate
