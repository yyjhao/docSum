since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
section 4 describes a method for learning semantic classification rules , while section 5 shows the results obtained for
the learning tree has two types of nodes : unambiguous nodes , corresponding to the sets of unambiguous examples from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.1 , 1.3.1 , and 1.4.1 from figure 3 -RRB- and ambiguous nodes , corresponding to each ambiguous example from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.2,1.3,1.4 , and 1.4.2 from figure 3 -RRB- .
the set of rules represents the rules to be used for classifying the new instances and the default value represents the target value -LRB- yes if an instance is a part-whole relation and no if the instance is not a part-whole relation -RRB- that should be returned if none of the rules classify the new instances .
we defined the task as a binary classification problem and used an approach that relies on the assumption that the semantic relation between two constituent nouns representing the part and the whole can be detected based on the components - semantic classification rules .
