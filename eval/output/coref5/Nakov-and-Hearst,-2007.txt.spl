girju et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- apply svm , decision trees , semantic scattering and iterative semantic specialization , using wordnet , word sense disambiguation , and linguistic features .
finally , in a previous publication -LRB- nakov and hearst , 2006 -RRB- , we make the claim that the relation between the nouns in a noun-noun compound can be characterized by the set of intervening verbs extracted from the web .
given an entity-annotated example sentence , we reduce the target entities e1 and e2 to single nouns noun1 and noun2 , by keeping their last nouns only , which we assume to be the heads .
we then mine the web for sentences containing both noun1 and noun2 , from which we extract features , consisting of word -LRB- s -RRB- , part of speech -LRB- verb , preposition , verb + preposition , coordinating conjunction -RRB- , and whether noun1 precedes noun2 .
in fact , our category c system is the best-performing -LRB- in terms of f and acc -RRB- among the participating systems , and we achieved the third best results for category a. our category c results are slightly but consistently better than for a for all measures -LRB- p , r , features used leave-1-out test ucb f , acc -RRB- , which suggests that knowing the query is helpful .
we show the results for : -LRB- a -RRB- leave-one-out cross-validation on the training data , -LRB- b -RRB- on the test data , and -LRB- c -RRB- our official ucb
