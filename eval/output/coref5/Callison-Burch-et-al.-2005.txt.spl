in this paper we : motivate the problem with storing enumerated phrases in a table by examining the memory requirements of the method for the nist data set detail the advantages of using long phrases in smt , and examine their potential coverage describe a suffix array-based data structure which allows for the retrieval of translations of arbitrarily long phrases , and show that it requires far less memory than a table calculate the computational complexity and average time for retrieving phrases
in order to adapt suffix arrays to be useful for statistical machine translation we need a data structure with the following elements : a suffix array created from the source language portion of the corpus , and another created from the target language portion of the corpus , an index that tells us the correspondence between sentence numbers and positions in the source and target language corpora , an alignment a for each sentence pair in the parallel corpus , where a is defined as a subset of the cartesian product of the word positions in a sentence e of length i and a sentence f of length j : a method for extracting the translationally equivalent phrase for a subphrase given an aligned sentence pair containing that sub-phrase .
