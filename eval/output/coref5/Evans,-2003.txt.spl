section 2 describes the methods by which nero addresses its goals - deriving a document specific ontology for nes -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- ; identifying sequences of words that are normally capitalized in the document -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- ; and then classifying normally capitalized words with respect to the derived typology -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
use of the internet , rather then the documents in which nes appear , as the source of potential hypernyms is justified because the documents used to test the nero system in the present study are rather small , and the four patterns shown in figure 1 are used very rarely within them .
features appearing in the vectors include positional information , the proportion of times the word is capitalized in the document , the proportion of times the word is sentence initial in the document and in the bnc
the system is evaluated with respect to its ability to identify nes using text normalisation , to derive an appropriate typology of nes for a given document , and to classify nes in line with the derived typology .
table 2 shows , for each file in the test corpus , the set of ne types that were manually annotated in each document -LRB- ne types -RRB- and the set of ne types derived by nero -LRB- derived typology -RRB- .
