in the conditioning events , h is the head constituent above p , i \/ ir is the list of candidate antecedents to be considered , t is the type of phrase of the proposed antecedent -LRB- always a noun-phrase in this study -RRB- , 1 is the type of the head constituent , sp describes the syntactic structure in which p appears , cr specifies the distance of each antecedent from p and m is the number of times the referent is mentioned .
once we have the trees in the proper form -LRB- to the degree this is possible -RRB- we run hobbs ' algorithm repeatedly for each pronoun until it has proposed n -LRB- = 15 in our experiment -RRB- candidates .
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
the impact of this probability can be seen more clearly from another experiment in which we tested the program -LRB- using just hobbs distance and gender information -RRB- on the training data .
