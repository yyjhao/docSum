we first show the attractiveness of the left-right centering algorithm -LRB- henceforth lrc -RRB- -LRB- tetreault 1999 -RRB- given its incremental processing of utterances , psycholinguistic plausibility , and good performance in finding the antecedents of pronouns .
the algorithm is tested against three other leading pronoun resolution algorithms : hobbs 's naive algorithm -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , s-list -LRB- strube 1998 -RRB- , and bfp -LRB- brennan , friedman , and pollard 1987 -RRB- .
next we use the conclusions from two psycholinguistic experiments on ranking the cf-list , the salience of discourse entities in prepended phrases -LRB- gordon , grosz , and gilliom 1993 -RRB- and the ordering of possessor and possessed in complex nps -LRB- gordon et al. 1999 -RRB- , to try to improve the performance of lrc .
the elements of the s-list are separated into three information sets hearer-old discourse entities -LRB- old -RRB- , mediated discourse entities -LRB- med -RRB- , and hearer-new discourse entities -LRB- new -RRB- all of which are based on prince 's -LRB- 1981 -RRB- familiarity scale .
eight different corpus trials were carried out involving the two different parsing algorithms -LRB- lrc-f and lrc-s -RRB- and two different ordering modifications : -LRB- 1 -RRB- ranking the cf-list after processing and -LRB- 2 -RRB- modifying the order of entities before processing the utterance .
unlike the other three algorithms analyzed
this method , the s-list -LRB- salience list -RRB- , was motivated by the bfp algorithm 's problems with incrementality and computational overhead -LRB- it was also difficult to coordinate the algorithm with intrasentential resolution -RRB- .
