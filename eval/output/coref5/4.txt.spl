as a starting point we present the det curve of a detection system which had excellent performance in the tdt-2 -LSB- 3 -RSB- and tdt-3 -LSB- 4 -RSB- evaluations , converted to a naive tracking system as described above .
by viewing the resulting system 's performance in terms of recall and number of false alarms per topic , binned by the rate at which on-topic documents appear , we observe that current topic tracking technology is likely good enough for some applications .
for each topic , the documents judged by the ldc as on-topic were divided into training and test sets with 4 documents in the training set -LRB- although many of the tracking experiments presented here use only one document for training . -RRB-
our scoring formula is cluster dependent because of the '' dynamic word-weight '' where idf0 -LRB- w -RRB- is the
this leads us to make two observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a topic detection system well - optimized to the tdt detection task converts into a naive tracking system that does not probe the area of interest to the tdt tracking task , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in order to convert a detection system into a tracking system , it is necessary to record the scores of all documents with respect to the topical cluster , not merely those documents that are merged into it .
