the idea of the grouping algorithm is that if we are highly confident about grouping two citations ci and c ; together
for example , assume that the correct grouping result for eight returned citations c1 , c2 , c3 , c4 , c5 , cs , c7 , c8 is : group 1 : -LCB- c1 , c2 , c4 , cs , c71 , group 2 : -LCB- c3 , c81 , group 3 : -LCB- c51 , and the grouping result of our system is : group 1 : -LCB- c1 , c2 , c41 , group 2 : -LCB- c3 , cs , c71 , group 3 : -LCB- c5 , c81 .
section 3 introduces our multi-faceted approach to solving the problem by explaining the three facets we use -LRB- attributes , links , and page similarity -RRB- , showing how to construct a confidence matrix for each facet and how to combine all the confidence matrices into a final confidence matrix , and giving the algorithm we use to group returned citations .
for example , we estimate p -LRB- same person = yes i share2 = yes -RRB- , which is the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the web pages referenced by them share exactly two adjacent cap-word pairs in our training set , by dividing the number of citation pairs that are related to the same person and share two cap-word pairs by the number of citation pairs that share two cap-word pairs .
