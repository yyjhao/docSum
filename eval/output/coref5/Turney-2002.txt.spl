the core of the algorithm is the second step , which uses pmi-ir to calculate semantic orientation -LRB- turney , 2001 -RRB- .
previous work on determining the semantic orientation of adjectives has used a complex algorithm that does not readily extend beyond isolated adjectives to adverbs or longer phrases -LRB- hatzivassiloglou and mckeown , 1997 -RRB- .
the jj tags indicate adjectives , the nn tags are nouns , the rb tags are adverbs , and the vb tags are verbs .4 the second pattern , for example , means that two
this suggests the hypothesis that a good movie will often contain unpleasant scenes -LRB- e.g. , violence , death , mayhem -RRB- , and a recommended movie review may thus have its average semantic orientation reduced if it contains descriptions of these unpleasant scenes .
the second step is to estimate the semantic orientation of each extracted phrase -LRB- hatzivassiloglou &amp; mckeown , 1997 -RRB- .
the algorithm has three steps : -LRB- 1 -RRB- extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs , -LRB- 2 -RRB- estimate the semantic orientation of each phrase , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- classify the review based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases .
although they do not consider the task of classifying reviews , it seems their algorithm could be plugged into the classification algorithm presented in section 2 , where it would replace pmi-ir and equation -LRB- 3 -RRB- in the second step .
