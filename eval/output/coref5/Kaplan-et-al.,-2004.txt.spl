we investigated the accuracy of recovering semantically-relevant grammatical dependencies from the tree-structures produced by the collins parser , comparing these dependencies to
performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
clearly , both versions of the xle system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the collins parser -LRB- 12 % for the core xle system and 20 % for the complete system -RRB- at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core xle system .
we compared the output of the xle system , a deep-grammar-based parsing system using the english lexical-functional grammar previously constructed as part of the pargram project -LRB- butt et al. , 2002 -RRB- , to the same gold standard .
we avoided the temptation of building coordinate distribution into the conversion routine because , first , it is not always obvious from the model 3 output when distribution should take place , and second , that would be a first step towards building into the conversion routine the deep lexical and syntactic knowledge -LRB- essentially the functional component of our lfg grammar -RRB- that the shallow approach explicitly discounts .
