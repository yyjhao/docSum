carpuat and wu -LRB- 2005 -RRB- integrated the translation predictions from a chinese wsd system -LRB- carpuat et al. , 2004 -RRB- into a chinese - english word-based statistical mt system using the isi rewrite decoder -LRB- germann , 2003 -RRB- .
to achieve this , when a grammar rule r is considered during decoding , and we recognize that some of the terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in a are also chosen by the wsd system as translations for some terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in - y , we compute the following features : note that we can take the negative logarithm of the rule \/ derivation weights and think of them as costs rather than probabilities .
after wsd , the ith word ci in every chinese sentence may have up to 3 sets of associated translations provided by the wsd system : a set of translations for ci as a single word , a second set of translations for ci _ 1ci considered as a single unit , and a third set of translations for cici + 1 considered as a single unit .
similar to -LRB- chiang , 2005 -RRB- , we trained the hiero system on the fbis corpus , used the nist mt 2002 evaluation test set as our development set to tune the feature weights , and the nist mt 2003 evaluation test set as our test data .
