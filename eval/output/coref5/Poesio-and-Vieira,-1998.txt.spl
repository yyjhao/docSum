they were asked to annotate 14 randomly selected wall street journal articles , all but one of them different from those used in experiment 1 , and containing 464 definite descriptions in total .1 ~ unlike in our first experiment , we did not suggest any relation between the classes and the syntactic form of the definite descriptions in the instructions .
this version of the system finds a classification for 355 descriptions out of 464 , and its agreement with the three annotators is k = 0.63 if the cases that the system can not classify
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
this class , that we will call larger situation \/ unfamiliar , includes both definite descriptions that exploit situational information -LRB- hawkins larger situation uses -RRB- and discourse - new definite descriptions introduced together with their links or referents -LRB- unfamiliar -RRB- .
