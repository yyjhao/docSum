examples include computer vision , where we need to figure out when regions in two different images refer to the same underlying object -LRB- the correspondence problem -RRB- ; natural language processing where we would like to determine which noun phrases refer to the same underlying entity -LRB- co-reference resolution -RRB- ; and databases , where , when merging two databases or cleaning a database , we need to determine when two records are referring to the same underlying individual -LRB- deduplication -RRB- .
the generative process in our model may be viewed as an extension of the dirichlet process mixture model : the group labels in our model influence the choice of entities for each author reference in a paper .
the sampling algorithm now also samples the author attributes vi iteratively , conditioned on the references and current author assignments , along with sampling the group and entity labels for each reference .
basic inference with gibbs sampling we first describe a novel but simple gibbs sampling algorithm for iteratively sampling the values of the hidden group and entity labels for each reference conditioned on
similarly , when 0 = 0 , a reference has to pick a group label from other references to the same author , and also an author label from other references with the same group label .
