lra proceeds as follows : find alternates : for each word pair a : b in the input set , look in the thesaurus for the top num _ sim words -LRB- in the following experiments , num _ sim = 10 -RRB- that are most similar to a. for each a ^ that is similar to a , make a new word pair a ^ : b. likewise , look for the top num _ sim words that are most similar to b , and for each b ^ , make a new word pair a : b ^ .
lra extends the vsm approach in three ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the patterns are derived automatically from the corpus -LRB- they are not predefined -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the singular value decomposition -LRB- svd -RRB- is used to smooth the frequency data -LRB- it is also used
calculate relational similarity : the relational similarity between a : b and c : d is the average of the cosines , among the -LRB- num _ filter + 1 -RRB- 2 cosines from step 11 , that are greater than or equal to the cosine of the original pairs , a : b and c : d. the requirement that the cosine must be greater than or equal to the original cosine is a way of filtering out poor analogies , which may be introduced in step 1 and may have slipped through the filtering in step 2 .
