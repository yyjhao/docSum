as a first step towards such approach , we demonstrate in this paper that category labels extracted from the first sentence of a wikipedia article , which can be thought of as the definition of the entity described in the article , are really useful to improve the accuracy of ner .
in our experiments using the conll 2003 ner dataset -LRB- tjong et al. , 2003 -RRB- , we demonstrate that we can improve performance by using the wikipedia features by 1.58 points in f-measure from the baseline , and by 1.21 points from the model that only uses the gazetteers provided in the conll 2003 dataset .
after the preprocessing described above , we extracted the first line in the remaining lines as the first sentence from which we extract a category label .
we did not utilize wikipedias category sections in this study , since a wikipedia article can have more than one category , and many of them are not clean hypernyms of the entity as far as we observed .
wikipedia category
we can see that gazzetta dello sport in the sentence was correctly labeled as an entity of org category by model -LRB- e -RRB- , because the wikipedia feature identified it as a newspaper entity.an issue , which we should treat , is the disambiguation of ambiguous entities .
