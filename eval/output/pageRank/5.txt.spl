we now construct our model m given the set of web pages d. let graph gls = -LRB- v , e -RRB- be the link structure graph over a set of web pages d if nodes of the graph are the web pages -LRB- v ^ d -RRB- and there exists an edge between any pair of nodes di and dj iff di and dj are linked to each other .
we applied cosine similarity with a novel variation of the tfidf term weighting function : the problem of web appearance disambiguation can be addressed within the standard clustering framework : the set of web pages d is split into m clusters , then one of the clusters is considered as containing only relevant pages while all the other clusters are irrelevant .
the main idea that
it can be seen in the graph that when the recall of the relevant cluster is around 45 % -LRB- there are five clusters overall -RRB- , the precision is very high -LRB- above 98 % -RRB- .3 this cluster contains two pages of bill mark the sri manager and none of the pages of bill mark the utexas professor ; it also contains 15 pages of fernando pereira the upenn professor and only one page of fernando pereira the professor of instituto superior tecnico .
