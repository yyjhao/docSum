we have implemented a logic prover , called cogex -LRB- from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate -RRB- which uniformly codifies the question and answer text , as well as world knowledge resources , in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers .
in addition to the logic representations of questions and candidate answers , the qa logic prover needs world knowledge axioms to link question concepts to answer concepts .
the challenges one faces when using automated reasoning in the context of nlp include : logic representation of open text , need of world knowledge axioms , logic representation of semantically equivalent linguistic patterns , and others .
two techniques have been implemented in cogex to deal with incomplete proofs : count the number of unifications \/ resolutions with terms in the question along the longest search path in the proof attempts , and relax the question logic form by incrementally uncoupling arguments in the predicates , and \/ or removing prepositions or modifiers that are not crucial to
a careful analysis indicates that the qa system without logic prover answered 317 questions and the prover can answer only 98 additional questions for which the system without prover failed .
