the part-whole relations
since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
for each set of unambiguous positive and negative examples at each level in the downward descent , we apply quinlan-s c4 .5 algorithm and learn classification rules of the form if x is \/ is not of a wordnet semantic class a and y is \/ is not of wordnet semantic class b , then the instance is \/ is not a part-whole relation .
thus , for the genitive cluster we used a training corpus of 27,961 positive examples -LRB- 325 pairs of concepts in a part-whole relation extracted from corpus - a - and 27,636 extracted from wordnet as selected pairs -RRB- and 18,611 negative examples -LRB- the non-part-whole relations extracted from corpus - a - -RRB- .
if there is no unambiguous node lu -LRB- and therefore default value du -RRB- , the default value for the first ambiguous example is propagated to l. for instance , for the ambiguous node 1.4.2 -LRB- social relation # 1-social relation # 1 -RRB- , there were no unambiguous examples ; and therefore the default value from the node 1.4.2.1 -LRB- written communication # 2 - written communication # 2 -RRB- will be used .
