we show that although the edit
the f2 data also retains pairs like the following that involve both high-level semantic alternations and long distance dependencies : two men who robbed a jeweller 's shop to raise funds for the bali bombings were each jailed for % % number % % years by indonesian courts today .
the best overall performance , irrespective of test data type , is achieved by the l12 training set , with an 11.58 % overall aer on the 250 sentence pair edit distance test set -LRB- 20.88 % aer for non-identical words -RRB- .
the f2 training data is probably too sparse and , with 40 % unrelated sentence pairs , too noisy to achieve equally good results ; nevertheless the gap between the results for the two training data types is dramatically narrower on the f2 test data .
the nearly comparable numbers for the two training data sets , at 13.2 % and 14.7 % respectively , suggest that the l12 training corpus provides no substantive advantage over the f2 data when tested on the more complex test data .
the most common paraphrase alternations that we observed fell into the following broad categories : elaboration : sentence pairs can differ in total information content , with an added word , phrase or clause in one sentence that has no counterpart in the other -LRB- e.g. the nasdaq \/ the tech-heavy nasdaq -RRB- .
