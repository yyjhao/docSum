if our hypothesis holds -LRB- that ncs that fall within the same category pairs are assigned the same relation -RRB- , then if most of the ncs fall within only a few category pairs then we only need to determine which relations hold between a subset of the possible pairs .
finally , we analyzed three cps in category c -LRB- diseases -RRB- ; the most frequent cp in terms of the total number of non-unique ncs is c04 -LRB- neoplasms -RRB- a1 1 -LRB- cells -RRB- , with 30606 ncs ; the second cp was a10 c04 -LRB- 27520 total ncs -RRB- and the fifth most frequent , a01 c04 , with 20617 total ncs ; we analyzed these cps .
this fits nicely with our method of describing the ncs with the higher levels of the hierarchy : if most of the ambiguity is at the highest levels -LRB- as these results show -RRB- , information about lexical ambiguity is not lost when we describe the ncs using the higher levels of mesh .
to determine the answer , we could -LRB- i -RRB- look at all the cps , give a name to the relations and merge the cps that have the same relationships ; or -LRB- ii -RRB- draw a sample of nc examples for a given relation , look at the cps for those examples and verify that all
