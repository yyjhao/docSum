in recent years , the literature includes compelling evaluation results for several
since the publication of the treebank , published evaluations of non-treebank parsers -LRB- i.e. , parsers not designed with the conventions of the english language u. penn treebank in mind -RRB- are rarely encountered ; recent exceptions include an evaluation of the xerox lfg f - structure parser -LRB- riezler , 2002 -RRB- and the dependency parser of lin -LRB- 1995 , 1998 -RRB- .
a challenge posed by focusing on maximal projections of heads is the absence of annotations of heads and head inheritance in the treebank itself .1 to rectify this , we will employ a set of head-labeling rules and compute maximal projections of heads for the reference or gold treebank trees .
with these refinements , our metrics are , therefore , precision and recall of unlabeled brackets enclosing maximal projections of heads -LRB- mph -RRB- , defined as follows : the set of additional head reassignment rules for one nontreebank parser is likely to be different than the rule set for another such parser .
for the sake of a direct comparison with nlpwin , we apply the set of head reassignment rules -LRB- found as the common - ground between nlpwin and the charniak-headlabeled treebank -RRB- and compute the mph trees using the process defined in section 2 to arrive at the tree in figure 4 .
