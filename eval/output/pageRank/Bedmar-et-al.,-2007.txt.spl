the set of features used for the classification of semantic relations includes information from different levels : word tokens , pos tags , verb lemmas , semantic information from wordnet , etc .
semantic features are only applied in categories b and d. on the lexical level , the set of word features include the two nominals , their heads in case one of the nominals in question or both are compound nominals -LRB- e.g. the relation between &lt; e1 &gt; tumor shrinkage &lt; \/ e1 &gt; and &lt; e2 &gt; radiation therapy &lt; \/ e2 &gt; is actually between the head of the first '' shrinkage '' and '' radiation therapy '' -RRB- .
for each relation and for each category -LRB- a , b , c , d -RRB- we selected the set of features that obtained the best results using the indicated cross validation .
for the relation theme-tool , other set of features was employed : nominals , their heads , verb , preposition and the list of word between both nominals .
it is obvious that introducing wordnet information has improved notably the results compared with the results obtained in the category a. in categories c and d , only three groups have participated .
for example , in training the
in our first approach to automatic classification of semantic relations between nominals and as expected from the training phase , our system achieved its best performance using wordnet information .
