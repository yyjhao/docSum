below is a summary of the main contributions of this paper : algorithm for exploiting generic patterns : unlike previous algorithms that require significant manual work to make use of generic patterns , we propose an unsupervised web-filtering method for using generic patterns
espresso addresses the desiderata as follows : performance : espresso generates balanced precision and recall relation instances by exploiting generic patterns ; minimal supervision : espresso requires as input only a small number of seed instances ; breadth : espresso works on both small and large corpora it uses web and syntactic expansions to compensate for lacks of redundancy in small corpora ; generality : espresso is amenable to a wide variety of binary relations , from classical is-a and part-of to specific ones such as reaction and succession .
following -LRB- pantel et al. 2004 -RRB- , we define the relative recall of system a given system b , ra | b , as : where ra is the recall of a , ca is the number of correct instances extracted by a , c is the -LRB- unknown -RRB- total number of correct instances in the corpus , pa is as precision in our experiments , and | a | is the total number of instances discovered by a. tables 2-8 report the total number of instances , precision , and relative recall of each system on the trec-9 and chem corpora .
