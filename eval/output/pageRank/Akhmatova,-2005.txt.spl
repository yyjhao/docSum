a logical meaning representation of a sentence
we use the length of a path -LRB- take overbuy has a length 2 , form-make-establish has a length 3 ; the longer the path , the less is the relatedness -RRB- ; the amount of sense of the words that is on the path between these two words -LRB- two words connected with a verb print , for example , are more close to each other , as the words connected via make , because print has only 4 senses and make has 49 -RRB- ; and the total number of different paths -LRB- the words which senses are connected through 10 different paths are more related then the words having only one connecting path , for example -RRB- .
after the algorithm is the following -LRB- figure 2 : otter and its input data ; and figure 4 -RRB- : if for every proposition in the hypothesis sentence there is one in the text sentence from that it could be entailed then the sentence entailment holds , otherwise the entailment does not hold .
if there is none , find the closest -LRB- with the higher relatedness score according to wordnet -LRB- see section 7 -RRB- -RRB- atomic proposition x and create a rule prop x - &gt; prop y. so , what we can learn is : reduce the risk of diseases - &gt; have health benefits .
