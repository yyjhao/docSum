thus these document pairs and transliteration pairs mutually reinforce each other , and this can be exploited to further optimize our transliteration scores by allowing transliteration pairs to propagate their scores to each other according to their co-occurrence strengths .
in order to see more clearly
indeed , although the performance of the frequency correlation method alone is much worse than that of the phonetic correspondence method , when working on the subset of candidates passing the phonetic filter -LRB- i.e. , those candidates that have a reasonable phonetic alignment with the english name -RRB- , it can outperform the phonetic correspondence method .
we see that , as expected , the performance on the augmented candidate list , which can be interpreted as an upper bound of our method , is indeed much better , suggesting that if we can somehow improve the candidate generation method to include the answers in the list , we can expect to significantly improve the performance for all the methods .
the relative performance of different methods on this augmented candidate list is roughly the same as on the original candidate list , except that the freq + phoneticfilter is slightly worse than that of the phonetic method alone , though it is still much better than the performance of the frequency correlation alone .
