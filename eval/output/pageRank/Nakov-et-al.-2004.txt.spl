in addition to supporting advance queries over facts as just described , citation indexes can be improved by combining methods that use citances context -LRB- e.g. , mercer and di marco -LSB- 23 -RSB- -RRB- with methods that use citances content -LRB- e.g. -LSB- 7 -RSB- -RRB- .
this is followed by a description of an algorithm for paraphrasing citances that discuss the same relationship between entities , its evaluation and relationship to related work on paraphrases extraction .
they use the identified citances to improve summarization performance by using them as a feature when classifying candidate sentences in the citing paper , giving lower weight to citances as compared to other sentences .
in the next subsections we describe how these paraphrases are extracted from the citances and present a preliminary evaluation of the results for one set of citances .
table 1 shows that 81.82 % are labeled good or
this is partially due to the better sentence extraction for the first two sets , where more conservative regular expressions were used , while set 3 included truncated or merged sentences , or sentences coming from titles , which produced ungrammatical paraphrases .
we have demonstrated some initial results in paraphrasing citances that discuss the same topic , but more work remains to be done to improve results , and to group similar citances together .
