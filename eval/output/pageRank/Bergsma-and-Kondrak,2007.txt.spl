to create training data for our learning
thus one natural formulation for cognate identification is a pairwise -LRB- and symmetric -RRB- cognation classification that looks at each pair -LRB- f , e f -RRB- separately and individually makes a decision : in this formulation , the benefits of a discriminative approach are clear : it must find substrings that distinguish cognate pairs from word pairs with otherwise similar form .
for the dictionary-based cognate identification , we use french , spanish , german , greek -LRB- gr -RRB- , japanese -LRB- jp -RRB- , and russian -LRB- rs -RRB- to english translation pairs from the freelang program .3 the latter three pairs were chosen so that we can evaluate on more distant languages that use non-roman alphabets -LRB- although the r ^ omaji japanese is romanized by definition -RRB- .
across all the test sets , this modification results in a 6 % average gain in performance over baseline kr , but is still on average 5 % below the alignment - based discriminative technique , with a statistically significantly difference on each of the nine sets .6 figure 2 shows the relationship between training data size and performance in our bitext-based french-english data .
notice that unlike traditional similarity measures that always score identical words higher than all other pairs , by virtue of our feature weighting , our discriminative classifier prefers some pairs with very characteristic spelling changes .
