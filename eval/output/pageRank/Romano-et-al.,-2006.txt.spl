more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing variables , e.g. x buy y q x purchase y. under a syntactic representation , a template is a parsed text fragment , e.g. x s + interact md ^ with ~ n y -LRB- based on the syntactic dependency relations of the minipar parser -RRB- .
furthermore , we grouped template variants that are based on morphological derivations -LRB- e.g. x interact with y and x y interaction -RRB- and found that 4 groups , x interact with y , x bind to y , x associate with y and x complex with y , together with their morphological derivations , cover 45 % of the template instances .
candidate pairs that do not consist of two proteins , as tagged in the input dataset , were filtered out -LRB- see section 4.1 ; recall that our experiments were applied to the dataset of protein interactions , which isolates the re task from the protein name recognition task -RRB- .
to handle
the 1st line shows the coverage of the 119 templates learned by tease for the input template x interact with y. it is interesting to note that , though we aim to learn relevant templates for the specific domain , tease learned relevant templates also by finding anchor-sets of different domains that use the same jargon , such as particle physics .
