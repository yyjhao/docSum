semantic similarity measures defined over snippets , have been used in query expansion -LSB- 36 -RSB- , personal name disambiguation -LSB- 4 -RSB- and community mining -LSB- 6 -RSB- .
from the previous example , we form the pattern x is the largest y , where we replace the two words jaguar and cat by two wildcards x and y. our contributions in this paper are two fold : we propose an automatically extracted lexico-syntactic patterns-based approach to compute semantic similarity using text snippets obtained from a web search engine .
semantic similarity measures have been used in semantic web related applications such as automatic annotation of web pages -LSB- 7 -RSB- , community mining -LSB- 23 , 19 -RSB- , and keyword extraction for inter-entity relation representation -LSB- 26 -RSB- .
one must consider the page counts not just for the query p and q , but also for the individual words p and q to assess semantic similarity between p and q. we modify four popular co-occurrence measures ; jaccard , overlap -LRB- simpson -RRB- , dice , and pmi -LRB- point-wise mutual information -RRB- , to compute semantic similarity using page counts .
we score the word pairs in miller-charles dataset using the page-count-based similarity scores defined in section 3.2 , web-based semantic similarity measures proposed in previous work -LRB- sahami -LSB- 36 -RSB- , chen -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- and the proposed method -LRB- semsim -RRB- .
we represent each snippet as a bag-of-words and calculate the similarity sim -LRB- sa , sb -RRB- between two
