from the previous example , we form the pattern x is the largest y , where we replace the two words jaguar and
one must consider the page counts not just for the query p and q , but also for the individual words p and q to assess semantic similarity between p and q. we modify four popular co-occurrence measures ; jaccard , overlap -LRB- simpson -RRB- , dice , and pmi -LRB- point-wise mutual information -RRB- , to compute semantic similarity using page counts .
this function returns a vector of patterns where each element is the normalized frequency of the corresponding pattern in the snippets for the query a b. we append similarity scores calculated using page counts in section 3.2 to create the final feature vector f for the word - pair -LRB- a , b -RRB- .
we score the word pairs in miller-charles dataset using the page-count-based similarity scores defined in section 3.2 , web-based semantic similarity measures proposed in previous work -LRB- sahami -LSB- 36 -RSB- , chen -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- and the proposed method -LRB- semsim -RRB- .
we represent each snippet as a bag-of-words and calculate the similarity sim -LRB- sa , sb -RRB- between two snippets sa , sbas follows , in formula 15 isi denotes the number of words in snippet s. we used different semantic similarity measures for sim in formula 15 and employed the group average agglomerative clustering explained in section 4.7 .
