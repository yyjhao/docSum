many algorithms have been proposed for measuring the attributional similarity between two words -LRB- lesk , 1969 ; resnik , 1995 ; landauer and dumais , 1997 ; jiang and conrath , 1997 ; lin , 1998b ; turney , 2001 ; budanitsky and hirst , 2001 ; banerjee and pedersen , 2003 -RRB- .
algorithms for measuring attributional similarity can be lexicon-based -LRB- lesk , 1986
in an analogy a : b : : c : d , where there is a high degree of relational similarity between a : b and c : d , if there is also a high degree of attributional similarity between and , and between and , then a : b : : c : d is a near analogy ; otherwise , it is a far analogy .
the novelty in turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; berland and charniak , 1999 -RRB- ; instead , they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words .
the single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -LRB- i.e. , it requires a training set of labeled data -RRB- , but we are using lra to measure the distance between a pair and its potential neighbors , and lra is itself determined in an unsupervised fashion -LRB- i.e. , lra does not need labeled data -RRB- .
