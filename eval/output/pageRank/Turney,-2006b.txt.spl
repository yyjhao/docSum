the term semantic similarity is misleading , because it refers to a type of attributional similarity , yet relational similarity is not any less
we conclude that there are enough near analogies in the 374 sat questions for attributional similarity to perform better than random guessing , but not enough near analogies for attributional similarity to perform as well as relational similarity .
this is similar to the problem of classifying semantic relations -LRB- section 3.4 -RRB- , except that information extraction focuses on the relation between a specific pair of entities in a specific document , rather than a general pair of words in general text .
the novelty in turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; berland and charniak , 1999 -RRB- ; instead , they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words .
the single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -LRB- i.e. , it requires a training set of labeled data -RRB- , but we are using lra to measure the distance between a pair and its potential neighbors , and lra is itself determined in an unsupervised fashion -LRB- i.e. , lra does not need labeled data -RRB- .
