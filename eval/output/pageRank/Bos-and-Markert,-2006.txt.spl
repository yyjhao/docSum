if vampire finds a proof for 1 , it is very likely that t entails h. if vampire finds a proof for 3 or 4 , then we are -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- dealing with inconsistent background knowledge and there is nothing we can say about the relationship between t and h -LRB- however , it could be the case that t + h is inconsistent , which would mean that t does not entail h -RRB- .
put differently , the domain size for t + h would equal the domain size of t. in contrast , if t does not entail h , h normally introduce some new information -LRB- except when it contains negated information -RRB- , and this will be reflected in the domain size of t + h , which then is larger than the domain size of t. it turns out that this difference between the domain sizes is a useful way of measuring the likelihood of entailment .
the theorem prover provides us with four features : entailed and entailedbk determining whether
therefore , we split the test data into three subsets : testshallow contains examples which could not be handled via the deep analysis because the examples either could not be parsed or because the theorem prover discovered an inconsistency of t or t \/ h with the background knowledge .
