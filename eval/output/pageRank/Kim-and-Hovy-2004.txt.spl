for our purposes , we describe an opinion as a quadruple -LSB- topic , holder , claim , sentiment -RSB- in which the holder believes a claim about the topic , and in many cases associates a sentiment , such as good or bad , with the belief .
for example , the following opinions contain claims but
when combining word-level sentiments , we therefore first determine for each holder a relevant region within the sentence and then experiment with various models for combining word sentiments .
section 2.1 describes the word sentiment classifier and section 2.2 describes the sentence sentiment classifier .
using these expanded lists , we extracted an additional cycle of words from wordnet , to obtain finally 5880 positive adjectives , 6233 negative adjectives , 2840 positive verbs , and 3239 negative verbs .
manual analysis showed that such sentiments can be found most reliably close to the holder ; without either holder or topic \/ claim nearby as anchor points , even humans sometimes have trouble reliably determining the source of a sentiment .
the first experiment examines the two word sentiment classifier models and the second the three sentence sentiment classifier models .
to test the identification of opinion holder , we first ran models with holders that were annotated by humans then ran the same models with the automatic holder finding strategies .
