hawkins classifies as immediate situation uses those definite descriptions whose referent is a constituent of the immediate situation in which the use of the definite description is located , without necessarily being visible : hawkins lists then two uses of definite descriptions characteristic of situations in which the speaker appeals
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
the agreement between the system and the three annotators on the two classes first mention and subsequent mention is k = 0.70 overall -LRB- k = 0.77 for the three annotators on the converted annotation -RRB- , if all definite descriptions to which the system cant assign a classification are treated as first-mention ; the coefficient of agreement is k = 0.78 if we do not count the definite descriptions that the system can not classify -LRB- k = 0.81 for the annotators on just those definite descriptions -RRB- .
