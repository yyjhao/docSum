the goal is to determine how many different people are represented for that name in the input web pages , and correctly assign each namesake to its corresponding subset of web pages .
we found that larger values for these data sets do not allow the hac algorithm to create enough
among the individual features , tokens and named entity features consistently show close to best performance for all training data sets .
using a web pages url itself in the features host + self and domain + self shows a larger increase in inverse purity at a smaller decrease in purity , hence these have improved f-measure in comparison to domain and host .
although the other two data sets may have popular people with many web pages , their web presence are usually created by others and often scatter across many domains with little hyperlinkage between them .
while the features generated by meurlin do improve the performance over pure host name and domain on the page urls , its incorporation in a richer feature set does not lead to better results , as the other features which have richer information to process .
furthermore , in the census data set , the combined features fail to outperform the individual ne and tokens features .
