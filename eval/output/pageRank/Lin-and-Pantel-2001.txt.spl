while richardson used paths as features to compute the similarity between words , we use words as features to compute the similarity of paths .
we make an assumption that this is an extension to the distributional hypothesis : extended distributional hypothesis : if two paths tend to occur in similar contexts , the meanings of the paths tend to be similar .
the mutual information between two events x and y is given by : mi -LRB- x , y -RRB- = log p -LRB- x , y -RRB- | p -LRB- x -RRB- p -LRB- y -RRB- .
given a path p , our algorithm for finding the most similar paths of p takes three steps : retrieve all the paths that share at least one feature with p and call them candidate paths .
for each of the paths p in the second column of table
although the triple database contains plenty of features for '' x leaves p '' , all of the similar paths found by dirt refer to the travel sense of leave , such as '' x flees p '' and '' x visits p '' .
another source of error in our algorithm is exemplified by the following : among the most similar paths of '' x asks p '' , we have '' x informs p '' -LRB- which is correct -RRB- , but also '' p asks x '' and '' p informs x '' .
