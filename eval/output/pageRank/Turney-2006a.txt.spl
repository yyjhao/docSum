in a widely cited paper , hearst -LRB- 1992 -RRB- showed that the lexico-syntactic pattern y such as the x can be used to mine large text corpora for word pairs x : y in which x is a hyponym -LRB- type -RRB- of y. for example , if we search in a large corpus using the pattern y such as the x and we find the string bird such as the ostrich , then we can infer that ostrich is a hyponym of bird .
as far as we know , our algorithm is the first unsupervised learning algorithm that can find patterns for semantic relations , given only a large corpus -LRB- e.g. , in our experiments , about 5 x 1010 words -RRB- and a moderately sized set of word pairs -LRB- e.g. , 600 or more pairs in the experiments -RRB- , such that the members of each pair appear together frequently in short phrases in the corpus .
for example , the phrase carpenter nails the wood yields the patterns x nails the y , x nails \* y , x \* the y , and x \* \* y. do not allow duplicate patterns in a list , but note the number of times a pattern is generated for each word pair xi : yi in each order -LRB- xi first and yi last or vice versa -RRB- .
