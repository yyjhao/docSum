wikipedia mining works in our system as follows : given the word pairs i , j -LRB- king and rook for instance -RRB- we first retrieve the wikipedia pages which they refer to .
we take the other word j \/ i and all the wikipedia internal links of the page pj \/ i as a lexical association list l to be used for disambiguation i.e. , we use the term list -LCB- rook , rook -LRB- chess -RRB- , rook -LRB- bird -RRB- , rook -LRB- rocket -RRB- , ... -RCB- for disambiguating the page
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path - based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
instead of integrating a word-vector based relatedness measure with a word - net based one , our results indicate that a competitive performance can be achieved also by simply using a different knowledge base such as wikipedia .
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
