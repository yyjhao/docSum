this paper presents a novel approach to answer validation based on the intuition that the amount of implicit knowledge which connects an answer to a question can be estimated by exploiting the redundancy of web information .
the retrieved documents are then used for determine an answer validation score as the composition of two alternative answer validation techniques , namely a statistical approach and a content-based approach .
the intuition underlying our approach
compute the set of representative keywords and both from and from , this step is carried out using linguistic techniques , such as answer type identification -LRB- from the question -RRB- and named entities recognition -LRB- from the answer -RRB- ; from the extracted keywords compute the validation pattern for the pair ; submit the validation pattern to a search engine ; estimate an answer relevance score -LRB- ars -RRB- considering the results returned by the search engine .
for every question-answer pair the answer validation module submits one query to the search engine , i.e. the validation pattern -LSB- and -RSB- built from the question and candidate answer keywords -LRB- see section 3 -RRB- .
in the first text snippet the distance between the candidate answer 1890 and all the question keywords -LRB- idaho , became and state -RRB- is 0 , since only stop-words are present between the candidate answer and the question keywords .
