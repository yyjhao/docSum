the intuition underlying our approach to answer validation is that , given a question - answer pair -LSB- , -RSB- , it is possible to formulate a set of validation statements whose truthfulness is equivalent to the degree of relevance of with respect to .
compute the set of representative keywords and both from and from , this step is carried out using linguistic techniques , such as answer type identification -LRB- from the question -RRB- and named entities recognition -LRB- from the answer -RRB- ; from the extracted keywords compute the validation pattern for the pair ; submit the validation pattern to a search engine ; estimate an answer relevance score -LRB- ars -RRB- considering the results returned by the search engine .
for every question-answer pair the answer validation module submits three searches to the search engine : the sub-patterns -LSB- qsp -RSB- and -LSB- asp -RSB- and the validation pattern -LSB- qap -RSB- built as the composition of the two sub-patterns using the altavista near operator .
to calculate answer validity score -LRB- in this example pmi -RRB- for -LSB- mississippi river -RSB- , the procedure constructs the validation pattern : -LSB- us near big near muddy near mississippi river -RSB- with the answer sub-pattern -LSB- mississippi river -RSB- .
for every question-answer pair the answer validation module submits one query to the search engine , i.e. the validation pattern -LSB- and -RSB- built from the question and candidate answer keywords -LRB- see section 3 -RRB- .
