the shared task
in this section we discuss the sources of the data that were used in this shared task , the preprocessing steps we have performed on the data , the format of the data and the method that was used for evaluating the participating systems .
the split between development data and test data was chosen to avoid systems being tuned to the test data .
table 3 : main features used by the the sixteen systems that participated in the conll-2003 shared task sorted by performance on the english test data .
aff : affix information -LRB- n-grams -RRB- ; bag : bag of words ; cas : global case information ; chu : chunk tags ; doc : global document information ; gaz : gazetteers ; lex : lexical features ; ort : orthographic information ; pat : orthographic patterns -LRB- like aa0 -RRB- ; pos : part-of-speech tags ; pre : previously predicted ne tags ; quo : flag signing that the word is between quotes ; tri : trigger words .
a majority vote of five systems -LRB- chieu and ng , 2003 ; florian et al. , 2003 ; klein et al. , 2003 ; mccallum and li , 2003 ; whitelaw and patrick , 2003 -RRB- performed best on the english development data .
another combination of five systems -LRB- carreras et al. , 2003b ; mayfield et al. , 2003 ; mccallum and li , 2003 ; munro et al. , 2003 ; zhang and johnson , 2003 -RRB- obtained the best result for the german development data .
