furthermore , it follows , as best as possible the recommendation of the entity and relation classifiers , but also satisfies natural constraints that exist on whether specific entities can be the argument of specific relations , whether two relations can occur together at the same time , or any other information that might be available at the inference time -LRB- e.g. , suppose it is known that entities a and b represent the same location ; one may like to incorporate an additional constraint that prevents an inference of the type : c lives in a ; c does not live in b -RRB- .
given that this is a difficult task which may require quite often information beyond the sentence , we consider also a forced decision task , in which we simulate a question answering situation we ask the system , say , who killed whom and evaluate it on identifying correctly the relation and its arguments , given that it is known that somewhere in this sentence this relation is active .
in addition , some other features are extracted
note that lp may change the predictions for either entity labels or relation labels , while pipeline fully trusts the labels of entity classifier , and only the relation predictions may be different from the basic relation classifier .
