for example , we estimate p -LRB- same person = yes i city = yes and state = yes -RRB- which is the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the web pages referenced by them share the same address city and state , by dividing the number of citation pairs that are related to the same person and have the same address city and state by the number of citation pairs that share same address city and state in the training set .
for our link facet , we use our training set to estimate the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the urls of the citations share the same non - popular host , or the url of one citation has the same non - popular host as one of the urls on the web page referenced by the other citation , or the urls of the citations share the same non-popular host and the url of one citation has the same non-popular host as one of the urls on the web page referenced by the other citation .
for example , we estimate p -LRB- same person = yes i share2 = yes -RRB- , which is the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the
