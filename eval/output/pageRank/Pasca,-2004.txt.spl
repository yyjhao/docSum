the fact and associated instance name are captured with a set of patterns which can be summarized as : the matching of the patterns in the sentences results in pairs -LRB- x , n -RRB- of categorical facts and instance names , which are underlined the sample sentence that is because software firewalls , including zone alarm , offer some semblance of this feature .
one of the following situations may occur as illustrated in table 1 : 1 -RRB- no plural-form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 2 -RRB- a plural - form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact , but it is immediately -LRB- e.g. , within 5 tokens -RRB- preceded by another plural-form noun phrase ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 3 -RRB- otherwise , the noun phrase is retained as the lexicalized category of the instance name n. note that one of the categories selected in table 1 is programming languages rather than other programming languages .
for illustration , according to the set of categorized names that we acquired in an experiment from web documents , the 10 most representative categories
table 7 shows a view opposite to table 6 , that is , instance names that belong to many categories , rather than categories with many instance names .
