phrase translation model probabilities are features of the form : the forward phrase probabilities p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are not used as features , but only as a filter on the set of possible translations : for each source phrase s ~ that matches some ngram in s , only the 30 top-ranked translations t ~ according to p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are retained .
we then define : c -LRB- ~ s , ~ t -RRB- as the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s ~ on the source side and t ~ on the target side ; c -LRB- ~ s -RRB- the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of s ~ on the source side ; and c -LRB- ~ t -RRB- the number of parallel sentences that contain one or more occurrences of t ~ on the target side .
since the contingency table with c -LRB- s , ~ t -RRB- = 1 having the greatest significance -LRB- lowest p-value -RRB- is the 1-1-1 table , using the threshold of a + e can be used to exclude all of the phrase pairs occurring exactly once -LRB- c -LRB- 9 , ~ t -RRB- = 1 -RRB- .
a special series of runs was done for threshold 14 with all of these singletons removed to see whether at these thresholds it was the significance level or the pruning of phrase pairs with -LRB- c -LRB- ~ s
