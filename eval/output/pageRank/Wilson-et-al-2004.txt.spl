also , where other research has focused on distinguishing between subjective and objective or positive and negative language , we address the task of classifying the strength of the opinions and emotions being expressed in individual clauses , considering clauses down to four levels deep .
a strength of neutral corresponds to the absence of opinion and subjectivity , so our strength classification task subsumes
although the above sets of subjectivity clues were selected because of their correlation with subjective language , they are not necessarily geared to discriminate between strong and weak subjectivity , and the groupings of clues into sets were not created with strength in mind .
to adapt the clues to strength classification , we use the annotations in the training data to filter the clues and organize them into new sets based on strength .
to study the feasibility of automatically classifying clauses by their subjective strength , we conducted a suite of experiments in which a strength classifier is trained based on the features previously described .
the gold standard strength ratings of sentences and clauses are based on the individual expression annotations : the strength of a sentence or clause is defined to be the highest strength rating of any expression in that sentence or clause .
