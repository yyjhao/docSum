this compound disambiguation system -LRB- named pro , for proportional relation occurrence ; see costello , veale , &amp; dunne , 2006 -RRB- makes use of a corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with word - net senses and covering 139 different semantic relations , with each noun and each relation annotated with its correct wordnet sense .1 section 2 of the paper will describe the format and structure of this corpus , section 3 will describe the original pro compound disambiguation system , and section 4 will explain how the pro system was adapted to deduce the correct semantic relation between a pair of nominals , as in semeval task 4 .
for each sense-pair , the algorithm goes through the corpus of compounds and extracts every compound whose modifier sense -LRB- or a hypernym of that sense -RRB- is equal to the modifier sense in the current sense-pair , and whose head sense -LRB- or a hypernym of that sense -RRB- is equal to the head sense in that pair .
this paper has described a system for automatically seslecting relations between nominals which uses the pro algorithm and compound corpus to form features for pairs of nominals -LRB- consisting of candidate relations and sense-pairs co-occurring with those relations -RRB- , and uses a naive bayes algorithm to learn to identify relations between nominals from those features .
