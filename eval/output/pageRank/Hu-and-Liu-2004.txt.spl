given a set of customer reviews of a particular product , the task involves three subtasks : -LRB- 1 -RRB- identifying features of the product that customers have expressed their opinions on -LRB- called product features -RRB- ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- for each feature , identifying review sentences that give positive or negative opinions ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- producing a summary using the discovered information .
within a review some sentences may express
the system performs the summarization in three main steps -LRB- as discussed before -RRB- : -LRB- 1 -RRB- mining product features that have been commented on by customers ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- summarizing the results .
in the case where there is the same number of positive and negative opinion words in the sentence , we predict the orientation using the average orientation of effective opinions or the orientation of the previous opinion sentence -LRB- recall that effective opinion is the closest opinion word for a feature in an opinion sentence -RRB- .
while human taggers do not regard these sentences as opinion sentences as there is no indication of whether the user likes the features or not , our system labels these sentences as opinion sentences because they contain both product features and some opinion adjectives .
