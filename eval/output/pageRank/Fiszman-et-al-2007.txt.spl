the processing of comparative expressions such as -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- was incorporated into an existing system , semrep -LSB- rindflesch and fiszman , 2003 ; rindflesch et al. , 2005 -RSB- , which constructs semantic predications by mapping assertions in biomedical text to the unified medical language system -LRB- umls -RRB- -LSB- humphreys et al. , 1998 -RSB- .
these were annotated with the pubmed id of the citation , names of two drugs -LRB- compared _ with predication -RRB- , the scale on which they are compared -LRB- scale -RRB- , and the relative position of the primary drug with respect to the secondary -LRB- same _ as , higher _ than , or lower _ than -RRB- .
the recall results indicate that approximately 30 % of the drugs and comparative structures of comp1 , as well as 40 % of comp2 structures , remain unrecognized ; however , all components are identified with high precision .
5 discussion in examining semrep errors , we determined that more than 60 % of the false negatives -LRB- for both comp1 and comp2 -RRB- were due to empty heads -LSB- chodorow et
we suggest one example of an application that can benefit from the information provided by the knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation of comparative structures , and that is the interpretation of outcome statements in medline citations , as a method for supporting automatic access to the latest results from clinical trials research .
