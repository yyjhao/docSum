we interpret semantic relations relative to a fixed set of constructions involving the modifier and head noun and a set of seed verbs for each semantic relation : e.g. -LRB- the -RRB- family owns -LRB- a -RRB- car is taken as evidence for family car being an instance of the possessor relation .
section 3 details the set of nc semantic relations that is used in our research , section 4 presents an extended discussion of our approach , section 5 briefly explains the tools we use , section 6.1 describes how we gather and process the data , section 6.2 explains how we map the verbs to seed verbs , and section 7 and section 8 present the results and analysis of our approach .
rosario and marti -LRB- 2001 -RRB- achieved about 60 % using a neural network in a closed domain , moldovan et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- achieved 43 % using word sense disambiguation of the head noun and modifier over open domain data , and kim and baldwin -LRB- 2005 -RRB- produced 53 % using lexical similarities of the
for a given modifier and head noun , our method extracted corpus instances of the two nouns in a range of constructional contexts , and then mapped the original verbs onto seed verbs based on lexical similarity derived from wordnet : : similarity , and moby s thesaurus .
