the simplification assumed above that coreference holds for all and only those pronouns for which textpro and hard constraints find a single possible antecedent is obviously false , but it nonetheless yields a model to seed the iterative part of the algorithm , which goes as follows : for each pronoun in the training data acquired in step 1 : apply the current maxent model to each pronoun-antecedent pair .
this hope is notwithstanding the fact that the algorithm is based on a simplifying assumption that each pronoun is associated with exactly one correct antecedent that is clearly false for a variety of reasons : -LRB- i -RRB- there will be cases in which there is more than one coreferential antecedent in the search window , all but one of which will get labeled as not coreferential during any given iteration , -LRB- ii -RRB- there will be cases in which the -LRB- perhaps only -RRB- correct antecedent was misparsed or incorrectly weeded out by hard constraints , and thus not seen by the learning algorithm -LRB- presumably some of the unambiguous cases identified in step 1c will be incorrect because of this -RRB- , and -LRB- iii -RRB- some of the pronouns found will not even be referential , e.g. pleonastic pronouns .
