to model collaborative relations between entities , we introduce a group label for each reference
the generative process in our model may be viewed as an extension of the dirichlet process mixture model : the group labels in our model influence the choice of entities for each author reference in a paper .
the sampling algorithm now also samples the author attributes vi iteratively , conditioned on the references and current author assignments , along with sampling the group and entity labels for each reference .
basic inference with gibbs sampling we first describe a novel but simple gibbs sampling algorithm for iteratively sampling the values of the hidden group and entity labels for each reference conditioned on the existing labels of all other references .
this algorithm iteratively samples the component label ai for the ith data object ri from the conditional distribution given the other labels : we may imagine lda-er as the dirichlet process mixture model augmented with a group structure above it that enables it to capture relations between the components or entities .
similarly , when 0 = 0 , a reference has to pick a group label from other references to the same author , and also an author label from other references with the same group label .
