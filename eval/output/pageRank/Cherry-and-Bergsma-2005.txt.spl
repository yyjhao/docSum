the majority of pronoun resolution approaches have thus far relied on manual intervention in the resolution process , such as using a manually-parsed corpus , or manually removing difficult non-anaphoric cases ; we follow -LRB- mitkov et al. -RRB- ' s approach -LRB- 2002 -RRB- with a fully-automatic pronoun resolution method .
we will consider our training set to consist of -LRB- p , k , c -RRB- triples : one for each pronoun , where p is the pronoun to be resolved , k is the pronouns context , and c is a candidate list containing the nouns p could potentially be resolved to .
if we assume that l and j are independent , and that p and k each depend only on the l component
the columns split the results into three cases : all pronouns with no exceptions ; all cases where the pronoun was found in a sentence containing no quotation marks -LRB- and therefore resembling the training data provided to em -RRB- ; and finally all pronouns excluded by the second case .
one factor that might help explain the initializers success is that despite using only a pru -LRB- pll -RRB- model , the initializer also has an implicit factor resembling a pr -LRB- l -RRB- model : when two candidates agree with the category of the pronoun , add-1 smoothing ensures the more frequent candidate receives a higher probability .
