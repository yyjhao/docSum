the theme of task 4 is the classification of semantic relations between simple nominals -LRB- nouns or base noun phrases -RRB- other than named entities honey bee , for example , shows an instance of the product-producer relation .
rosario and hearst -LRB- 2001 -RRB- classify noun compounds from the domain of medicine , using 13 classes that describe the semantic relation between the head noun and the modifier in a given

the data set that nastase and szpakowicz -LRB- 2003 -RRB- created had relation labels and part-of-speech and wordnet sense annotations , to facilitate classification .
we distinguish four categories of systems based on the type of information used wordnet senses and \/ or google queries : wordnet = yes or wordnet = no tells us only whether a system uses the wordnet sense labels in the data sets .
the data included different types of information lexical semantic information , context , query used meant to facilitate the analysis of useful sources of information for determining the semantic relation between nominals .
