the algorithm is tested against three other leading pronoun resolution algorithms : hobbs 's naive algorithm -LRB- 1978 -RRB- , s-list -LRB- strube 1998 -RRB- , and bfp -LRB- brennan , friedman , and pollard 1987 -RRB- .
next we use the conclusions from two psycholinguistic experiments on ranking the cf-list , the salience of discourse entities in prepended phrases -LRB- gordon , grosz , and gilliom 1993 -RRB- and the ordering of possessor and possessed in complex nps -LRB- gordon et al. 1999 -RRB- , to try to improve the performance of lrc .
unlike the other three algorithms analyzed in this project , the hobbs algorithm does not appeal to any discourse models for resolution ; rather , the parse tree
the elements of the s-list are separated into three information sets hearer-old discourse entities -LRB- old -RRB- , mediated discourse entities -LRB- med -RRB- , and hearer-new discourse entities -LRB- new -RRB- all of which are based on prince 's -LRB- 1981 -RRB- familiarity scale .
in short , the s-list method continually inserts new entities into the s-list in their proper positions and '' cleanses '' the list after each utterance to purge entities that are unlikely to be used again in the discourse .
in this paper we first presented a new pronoun resolution algorithm , left-right centering , which adheres to the constraints of centering theory and was inspired by the need to remedy a lack of incremental processing in brennan , friedman , and pollard 's -LRB- 1987 -RRB- method .
