and third , we provide the first evaluation of a wide - coverage ccg parser outside of ccgbank , obtaining impressive results on depbank and
more formally , a ccg predicate-argument dependency is a 5-tuple : -LRB- h f , f , s , ha , l -RRB- , where h f is the lexical item of the lexical category expressing the dependency relation ; f is the lexical category ; s is the argument slot ; ha is the head word of the argument ; and l encodes whether the dependency is long-range .
we chose this resource for the following reasons : it is publicly available , allowing other researchers to compare against our results ; the grs making up the annotation share some similarities with the predicate - argument dependencies output by the ccg parser ; and we can directly compare our parser against a non-ccg parser , namely the rasp parser .
in the example , the current category is -LRB- s -LSB- dcl -RSB- \ np1 -RRB- \/ -LRB- s -LSB- to -RSB- \ np -RRB- 2 , which is associated with wants ; this combines with -LRB- s -LSB- to -RSB- \ np -RRB- \/ -LRB- s -LSB- b -RSB- \ np -RRB- , associated with to ; and the argument of -LRB- s -LSB- to -RSB- \ np -RRB- \/ -LRB- s -LSB- b -RSB- \ np -RRB- is wean .
the overall f-score for the ccg parser , 81.86 % , is only 3 points below that for ccgbank , which provides an upper bound for the ccg parser -LRB- given the conversion process being used -RRB- .
