we compute recall , precision , and f1 over the phrase pairs extracted from the word alignments as follows : validity of phrase pairs according to the phrase extraction heuristic .
the quality of an alignment a -LRB- defined in equation -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- compared to reference alignment b can be then computed using standard recall , precision , and f1 measures -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : to give an example , consider the sentence pairs in figure 2 , whose alignments have been produced by the two annotators a -LRB- left -RRB- and b -LRB- right -RRB- .
these include phrase pairs whose words are aligned to each other or nothing , but not to words outside the phrase boundaries .10 the phrase extraction heuristic creates masses of phrase pairs , many of which are of dubious quality .
in addition , we obtained a trial set of 50 sentences from the mtc corpus which was used for familiarizing our annotators with the paraphrase alignment task -LRB- this set does not form part of the corpus -RRB- .
the phrase extraction heuristic allows each contiguous span in
to evaluate this , we had two annotators review a random sample of 166 atomic phrase pairs drawn from the mtc corpus -LRB- sure -RRB- , classifying each phrase pair as correct , incorrect , or uncertain given the sentence pair as context .
