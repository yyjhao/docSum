the standard process for pattern-based relation extraction is to start with hand-selected patterns or word pairs expressing a particular relationship , and iteratively scan
we refer to a pattern contained in our clusters -LRB- a pattern type -RRB- as a pattern and to an occurrence of a pattern in the corpus -LRB- a pattern token -RRB- as a pattern instance .
unlike most previous work , our hook words are not provided in advance but selected randomly ; the goal in those papers is to discover relationships between given word pairs , while we use hook words in order to discover relationships that generally occur in the corpus .
to avoid the selection of common words as target words , and to avoid targets appearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed multiword expressions , we sort all target words in a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual information between hook and target , and drop patterns obtained from pattern instances containing the lowest and highest l percent of target words .
we merge clusters from different hook corpora using the following algorithm : we start from the smallest clusters because we expect these to be more precise ; the best patterns for semantic acquisition are those that belong to small clusters , and appear in many different clusters .
