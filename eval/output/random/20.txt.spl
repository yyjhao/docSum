in -LSB- 11 , 12 -RSB- magennis and van rijsbergen , based on earlier work by harman -LSB- 7 -RSB- , carried out an experiment to estimate how good iqe could be if performed by expert searchers .
the experiments themselves were carried out on the associated press -LRB- ap 1998 -RRB- , san jose mercury news -LRB- sjm 1991 -RRB- , and wall street journal
the argument for iqe , based on this analysis , is mixed .
users , especially in web searches , often use very short queries -LSB- 9 -RSB- .
the sizes of the average of the best aqe decisions are also within a similar range -LRB- table 5 , row 2 -RRB- .
the poor terms are oswald , dealei , kwitni , theori , documentari , frenchi and bulletin , and the neutral terms are warren , theorist and belin .
however , we did not ask the subjects to read the non-relevant retrieved documents as we felt this was too great a burden on the subjects .
in general this may be a sensible approach if the query does not mention specific numbers or dates .
that is , the subjects tended to concentrate on terms for new queries rather than modified or refined queries .
this may be particularly true for certain types of search , e.g. in -LSB- 6 -RSB- fowkes and beaulieu showed that searchers preferred iqe when dealing with complex query statements .
