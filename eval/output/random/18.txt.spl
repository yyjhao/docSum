now consider a scenario where a user wants to organize documents on their desktop into categories of their choice .
active learning techniques are sequential learning methods that are designed to reduce manual training costs in achieving adequate learning performance .
the teacher is a human in the text categorization domain .
the train classifier subroutine uses the labeled data as training , as well as the model -LRB- m -RRB- learned in a previous iteration , allowing for the case of incremental training -LRB- domeniconi and gunopulos , 2001 -RRB- or the case when the model may be initialized by prior knowledge -LRB- wu and srihari , 2004 -RRB- .
in section 3.4 we describe how this oracle is approximated in our experiments .
for example , sports encompasses more focused groups like baseball and hockey .
for deficiency a lower value is better .
the second column -LRB- k = n -RRB- in
next we determine if humans can identify these important features .
table 2 also shows the times taken for labeling features and documents .
but since she was made to judge terms before documents this user s judgment had marked the term ct as non-relevant \/ don t know .
we showed that such an approach has good potential in significantly decreasing the overall amount of interaction required for training the system .
