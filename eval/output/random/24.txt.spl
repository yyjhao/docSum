documents categorization is one solution to this problem .
a major characteristic , or difficulty , of text categorization problems is the high dimensionality of the feature space .
section 4 presents the experiments and the results .
let -LCB- ci -RCB- mi = 1 denote the set of categories in the target space .
we use the more general form because text categorization problems usually have a m-ary category space -LRB- where m may be up to tens of thousands -RRB- , and we need to measure the goodness of a term globally with respect to all categories on average .
mutual information is a criterion commonly used in statistical language modelling of word associations and related applications -LSB- 7 , 2 , 21 -RSB- .
5 -RRB- the two classifiers differ statistically .
sperformance measures .
the effectiveness of a feature selection method is evaluated using the performance of knn and llsf on the preprocessed documents .
a natural question therefore is whether these three corpus statistics are correlated .
this bias becomes extreme when pr -LRB- t -RRB- is near zero .
to be more precise , in theory , ig measures the number of bits of information obtained by knowing the presence or absence of a term in a document .
our experiments quantitatively address this issue using a cross-method comparison and a cross-classifier validation .
this suggests that
