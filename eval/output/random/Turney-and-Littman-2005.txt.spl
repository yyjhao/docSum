we also discuss related work on web mining for natural language processing applications -LRB- section 2.4 -RRB- .
one of the thirteen modules was the vsm module , exactly as presented here in section 3.2 .
the vectors characterize the semantic relationship between a pair of words , rather than the meaning of a single word -LRB- lesk , 1969 -RRB- or the topic of a document -LRB- salton and mcgill , 1983 -RRB- .
the memory base stored triples , consisting of a noun , its modifier , and -LRB- if available -RRB- a marker .
however , most noun-modifier pairs are not logical metonymies , and the two tasks seem different , since it
the semantic relation between a pair of words may have no direct , obvious connection to the individual words themselves .
thus it is useful to have a way of adjusting the balance between precision and recall .
figure 1 shows precision , recall , and f as the threshold on the margin varies from 0.11 to + 0.11 .
although altavista is willing to support automated queries of the kind described here , as a courtesy , we inserted a five second delay between each query .
section 4.2 presents the classes of noun - modifier relations that are used in our experiments -LRB- nastase and szpakowicz , 2003 -RRB- .
for each noun-modifier pair that is to be classified , we find the two nearest neighbors .
