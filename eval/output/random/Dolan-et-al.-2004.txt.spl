likely paraphrase pairs even when they have little superficial similarity .
the clustering algorithm takes into account the full text of each news article , in addition to temporal cues , to produce a set of topically and temporally related articles .
we will refer to this dataset as l12 .
this is a robust new step that allows us to make much larger pieces .
an artificial bacteria-eating virus has been made from synthetic genes in the record time of just two weeks .
an additional filter ensured that the word count of the shorter sentence is at least one-half that of the longer sentence .
out of a sample of 448 held-out sentence pairs , 118 -LRB- 26.3 % -RRB- were rated by two independent human evaluators as sentence-level paraphrases , while 151 -LRB- 33.7 % -RRB- were rated as partial paraphrases .
tagged corpus of alignments serving as the gold standard .
och also documents a method for heuristically recombining the unidirectional alignments intended to balance precision and recall .
synonymy : sentence pairs differ only in one or two words -LRB- e.g. charges \/ accusations -RRB- , suggesting an editor s hand in modifying a single source sentence .
anaphora : a full np in one sentence corresponds to an
in this case all instances were counted .
algorithms to address these phenomena will be equally applicable to both fields .
