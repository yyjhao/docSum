all assertions made in an entailed sentence must be made in the text passage directly , or be logically derivable from it .
axiom generation .
axioms in our system are utilized to provide external world knowledge , knowledge of syntactic equivalence between logic form predicates , and lexical knowledge in the form of lexical chains .
we incorporate a small common-sense knowledge base of 310 world knowledge axioms , where
currently , this data set is too small to have a significant impact , but in combination with lexical chains , the coverage of these axioms will grow .
these axioms are automatically generated by the system through logic form and parse tree analysis .
however , without a large set of different human annotations for the data set , it is impossible to calculate this metric .
proofs are considered easy in cases where the entailment is simply a matter of eliminating information from the first sentence , recognizing an apposition or replacing one or two words with synonyms .
consider the following example : the expectation is that all entailment pairs that have been deemed easy or moderate can be handled by our current system implementation .
we have labeled t-h pairs as intractable if we believe that entailment could not be correctly detected by an automated system .
