our current project focuses on biomedical text , both because it poses interesting challenges , and because it should be possible to make inferences about propositions that hold between scientific concepts within biomedical
we have found that we can use such algorithms to classify relationships between two-word noun compounds with a surprising degree of accuracy .
section 6 concludes the paper and discusses future work .
li and abe -LRB- 1998 -RRB- use a minimum description length-based algorithm to find an optimal tree cut over wordnet for each classification problem , finding improvements over both lexical association -LRB- hindle and rooth , 1993 -RRB- and conceptual association , and equaling the transformation-based results .
downing -LRB- 1977 -RRB- argues that the semantics of ncs can not be exhausted by any finite listing of relationships .
we used a feed-forward network trained with conjugate gradient descent .
on the other hand , if we look at relations 14 and 15 , we find a wider range of words , and in some cases the words in the test set are not present in the training set .
other test set words such as immunisation and carcinogen do not appear in the training set at all .
in other words , it seems that the meshk-based categorization does better when generalization is required .
conclusions .
our approach handles mixed-class relations naturally .
