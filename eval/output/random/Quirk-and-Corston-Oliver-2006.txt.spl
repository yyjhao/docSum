we have shown that such a system is sensitive to the quality of the input syntactic analyses .
in the introduction we mentioned the concern that others have raised when we have presented our research : syntax might contain valuable information but current parsers might not be of sufficient quality .
it is certainly true that the accuracy of the best parser used here falls well short of what we
despite the degradation in parse accuracy caused by the dramatic differences between the wall street journal text and the technical articles , the treelet smt system was able to extract useful patterns .
one concern in applying the treelet smt framework to translation from languages other than english has been the expense of data annotation : would we require 40,000 sentences annotated for syntactic dependencies , i.e. , an amount comparable to the penn treebank , in order to train a parser that was sufficiently accurate to achieve the machine translation quality that we have seen when translating from english ?
the current study gives hope that source languages can be added with relatively modest investments in data annotation .
we challenge others who are conducting research on syntactically-informed smt to verify whether or to what extent their systems are sensitive to parse quality .
