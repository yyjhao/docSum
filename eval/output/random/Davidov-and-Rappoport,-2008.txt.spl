second , we merge clusters that share more than s percent of their patterns .
the purpose of this stage is to create clusters of patterns that express generic relationships rather than ones specific to a single hook word .
on our development set we have tested various parameter settings .
naturally , the parameters are not mutually independent .
fc -LRB- upper bound for content
since content words determine the joining of patterns into clusters , the more ambiguous a word is , the noisier the resulting clusters .
in extreme cases , low values can start a chain reaction of total merging .
in our experiments we have used the following values -LRB- again , determined using a development set -RRB- for these parameters : fc : 1 , 000 words per million -LRB- wpm -RRB- ; fh : 100 wpm ; fb : 1.2 wpm ; n : 500 words ; w : 5 words ; l : 30 % ; 5 : 2 \/ 3 ; a : 0.1 .
we addressed the evaluation questions above using a sat-like analogy test automatically generated from word pairs captured by our clusters -LRB- see below in this section -RRB- .
in our sample there were no word pairs assigned as labels to more than one cluster4 .
second , our clusters distinguish between different relationships , because the three pairs not expressing the same relationship as the header were not selected by the evaluators .
