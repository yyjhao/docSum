query definition , display , and interaction are the topic of section 6 .
in this section , we discuss patterns in applications , the repertoire of images , the influence of the scene and the role of domain knowledge , and the semantic gap between image features and the user .
although each face is unique and has large variability in the visual details , there are obvious geometrical , physical , and color-related constraints governing the domain .
this reduces

salient features .
they can also be applied to compare the equality of two histograms and all variations thereof .
when based on a metric , dissimilarity measures will render an ordered range of deviations suited for a predictable interpretation .
in the first place , the color , texture , or local shape characteristics may be used to identify the salient points of the data as identical to the salient points of the query .
this saves the effort of labeling the entire data set , unfeasible and unreliable as it grows big .
the segmentation result is improved if the user may annotate the template with salient details like color corners and specific textures .
strong segmentation of the scene and complete feature descriptions may not be necessary at all to achieve the similarity ranking .
