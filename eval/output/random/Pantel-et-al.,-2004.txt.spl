our pattern-based algorithm is very similar to the one used by hearst .
much of the research discussed above takes a similar approach of searching text for simple surface or lexico-syntactic patterns in a bottom-up approach .
if the word wave occurred in this context , then the con - text is a feature of wave .
following -LRB- pantel and lin 2002 -RRB- , a committee for each semantic class is constructed .
a committee is a set of representative elements that unambiguously describe the members of a possible class .
the highest scoring term is the name of the class .
just to parse a 1 tb corpus , this approach requires approximately 10.2 years -LRB- see table 2 -RRB- .
for example , consider the following 2 sentences : applying a pos tagger -LRB- brill 1995 -RRB- gives the following output : algorithm .
time complexity .
news 0.5 gb , ap newswire 2gb , new york times 2gb , reuters 0.8 gb , wall street journal 1.2 gb , and various online news website 1.5 gb .
from each resulting set , we then randomly selected 50 words along with their top 3 highest ranking is-a relationships .
recall .
to approximate recall , we defined a relative recall measure and conducted a question answering -LRB- qa -RRB- task of answering definition questions .
we compare the results of both our systems with wordnet .
