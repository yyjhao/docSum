the most common of such simplifications include shallow phrase structure trees where empty nodes -LRB- which represent syntactic phenomena such as long-distance dependencies and ellipsis -RRB- and function tags -LRB- which indicate the grammatical or semantic function of specific phrases -RRB- are removed -LRB- ratnaparkhi , 1997 ; collins 1997 ; charniak , 2000 ; charniak and johnson , 2005 -RRB- , and bilexical dependencies obtained from these shallow phrase structure trees -LRB- eisner , 1996 ; nivre and scholz , 2004 ; mcdonald et al. , 2005 -RRB- with the use of a head percolation table -LRB- magerman , 1995 ; collins 1999 -RRB- .
however , because an automatic conversion procedure from shallow ptb structures to sd is available , sd has recently been used in evaluations of parsers in the biomedical domain -LRB- clegg and shepherd , 2007 ; pyysalo et al. , 2007a -RRB- .
a gold-standard test set of 500 sentences from the susanne corpus was released initially ' , and has been followed by
the abundance of development data and the different nature of the conversion -LRB- no need to map to grammatical functions -RRB- resulted in much higher accuracy for this type of conversion .
tables 5 and 6 show the results for ptb and sd evaluations , respectively .
we have also found that converting from the phrase structure output of a deep parser to shallow ptb phrase structures can be done with relatively high accuracy .
