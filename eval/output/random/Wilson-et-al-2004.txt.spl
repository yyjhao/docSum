inter-annotator agreement for strength ratings is challenging .
first , we parse the training sentences in the mpqa corpus with a broad-coverage lexicalized english parser -LRB- collins , 1997 -RRB- .

a clue is considered to be potentially useful if more than x % of its occurrences in the mpqa training data are in phrases marked as subjective , where x is a parameter tuned on development data -LRB- in our experiments , we chose x = 70 % -RRB- .
others perform automatic analyses of product reputations -LRB- morinaga et al. , 2002 ; nasukawa and yi , 2003 ; yi et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
