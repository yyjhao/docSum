another paper by voss describes its organization , citing some of the similarities with traditional thesauri that we have capitalized on in this paper -LSB- 17 -RSB- .
as a verified source of topics and semantic relations , wikipedi a has three main areas of application : improving ac cess to documents
domain-specific thesauri describe domains that are relatively static , such as science and medicine .
term occurrence and co - occurrence frequencies can be extracted from wikipedia articles just as they can from conventional corpora .
