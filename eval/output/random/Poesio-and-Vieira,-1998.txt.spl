the hypothesis was developed in recent years -LRB- kadmon , 1987 ; neale , 1990 ; cooper , 1993 -RRB- , in particular to address the problem of uniqueness within small situations . '
again , the schemes we have presented do not consider this issue .
we assigned to this class those definite descriptions that stand in an anaphoric or associative anaphoric relation with an antecedent explicitly mentioned in the text , but that are not identified by the same head noun as their antecedent .
our two subjects in this first experiment were graduate students in linguistics .
in order to check whether this latter was the case , we merged back the classes larger situation and unfamiliar into one , as we had in the experiment 1 : that is , we recomputed k after counting all definite descriptions classified as either larger situation or unfamiliar as members of the same class .
the results in table 9 confirm the indications obtained by computing agreement for a smaller number of classes : our subjects agree pretty much on co referential definite descriptions , but bridging references are not a
there were 29 cases of complete classification disagreement among annotators , i.e. , cases in which no two annotators classified a definite description in the same way , and 144 cases of partial disagreement .
