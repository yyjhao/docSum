the
other trees are more heterogeneous , in the sense that the meanings among the nodes are more diverse .
next we used mesh to characterize the ncs according to semantic category -LRB- ies -RRB- .
for 55 -LRB- 22 % -RRB- of the cps we had to descend 1 level -LRB- e.g. , a01 m01 : a01 m01 .898 , a01 m01 .643 -RRB- and for 7 cps -LRB- 2 % -RRB- we descended two levels .
analogously , for buffalo milk , caprine milk we also have two cps -LRB- b02 , j02 -RRB- -LRB- b02 , a13 -RRB- .
single mesh senses -LRB- no lexical ambiguity -RRB- but multiple readings for the relationships that therefore can not be predicted by the cp .
ideally , however , we would like to reduce the lexical ambiguity for similar senses and to retain it when the senses are semantically distinct -LRB- like , for example , for diet in case 4 -RRB- .
we may not be able to determine the total number of relations , or how often they repeat across different cps , until we examine the full spectrum of cps .
another quandary is illustrated by the ncs adolescent cancer , child tumors , adult dementia -LRB- in which adolescent , child and adult are age groups -RRB- and the heads are diseases .
for example , buitelaar -LRB- 1997 -RRB- notes that the noun book is assigned to seven different senses , including fact and section , subdivision .
