the organizers of the entailment challenge provided participants with development and test corpora , with 567 and 800 sentence pairs , respectively , manually annotated for logical entailment .
in this paper we describe a simple system based on lexical similarity , with two different word similarity measures .
to check for entailment , we compare the score against a threshold .
essentially , for every word in the hypothesis we find the most similar word in the text according to the measure wordsim -LRB- w1 , w2 -RRB- .
for our experiments we used normalized inverse collection frequency of words , calculated on a big collection of newspaper texts .
word similarity measures .
results .
discussion .
we give evaluation results for both our methods and also for a simple baseline that only considers lexical overlap , without wordnet and frequency information .
from the table it is clear that the overall accuracy of the system is relatively high only due to the resonable performance on the cd subtask .
we have not checked whether a simple word overlap baseline would give a reasonable performance for
note that we give precision -LRB- p -RRB- and recall -LRB- r -RRB- scores as well as accuracy .
although both our runs show significant improvement over random guessing , the improvement is based only on one subtask -LRB- cd -RRB- .
