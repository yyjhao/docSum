another problem with the previous similarity measures is that their underlying assumptions are often not explicitly stated .
almost all of the comparisons and evaluations of previous similarity measures have been based on empirical results .
our goal is to arrive at a definition of similarity that captures the above intuitions .
in this section , we first make a set of additional assumptions about similarity that we believe to be reasonable .
for example , the similarity between two documents can be calculated by comparing the sets of words in
we assume that the overall similarity of the two documents is a weighted average of their similarities computed from different perspectives .
string similarity .
the average precision values are then averaged over all the words in wroot .
it can be seen that much better results were achieved with sim than with the other similarity measures .
parsing took about 72 hours on a pentium 200 with 80mb memory .
instead , we are comparing a generic river and a generic ditch .
our definition of similarity yielded slightly higher correlation with human judgments than the other two measures .
maximum similarity values : with most similarity measures , the maximum similarity is 1 , except simresnik , which have no upper bound for similarity values .
