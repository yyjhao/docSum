we have built a system for noun modifier relationship -LRB- nmr -RRB- analysis that assigns semantic relationships in complex noun phrases .
leonards system -LRB- 1984 -RRB- assigns semantic labels to noun-noun compounds based on a dictionary that includes taxonomic and meronymic -LRB- part - whole -RRB- information , information about the syntactic behavior of nouns and about the relationships between nouns and verbs .
instead of memorizing complete noun phrases -LRB- or even complete subphrases -RRB- and analyses , the system reduces compound modifiers and compound heads to their own local heads and stores these reduced pairs with their assigned nmr .
if the current triple
if the minimum distance was 3 or 6 , there may be two candidate lists : lm contains the nmrs previously assigned to triples with matching m , lhwith matching h. the analyzer attempts to choose a set r of candidates to suggest to the user as the best nmrs for the current triple .
to compensate for the lack of previous analyses , the system relies on the help of a user , who supplies the correct nmr when the system can not determine it automatically .
furthermore , if the appropriate nmr is not among those suggested by the system , the user can request the complete list of paraphrases with the current modifier and head .
