for an actual use in practice , we prefer an approach that combines feature selection and instance selection -LRB- e.g. , as proposed in section 2.1 -RRB- because it also allows the system to benefit from the increase in the knowledge of the teacher or the process may help remind the teacher about the usefulness of features as she reads the
as mentioned in section 2.2 the difference between systems 3 and 4 is in that feature selection precedes active learning in the former , and the best feature subset is picked in a retrospective manner , while it follows active learning in the latter .
we then move on to discuss a real system which employs a two-tiered approach of document feedback and feature feedback like the system in figure 2 which we evaluate using a simulation : we obtain feedback on features and documents apriori , and use the judgments so obtained to measure the effectiveness of our approach .
budgeted learning also works on identifying the predictive features during an active learning setting , but in this case the feature values are unknown and there is a cost to finding each feature s value for each instance of interest -LRB- such as the outcome of blood test on an individual -RRB- -LRB- lizotte et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
