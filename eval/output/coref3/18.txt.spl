for an actual use in practice , we prefer an approach that combines feature selection and instance selection -LRB- e.g. , as
following the algorithm for system 3 -LRB- see section 2.2 , figure 3 -RRB- , let f = n -LRB- the total number of features -RRB- and let us assume that the oracle selects the k most important features -LRB- by information gain -RRB- in step 1 .
as mentioned in section 2.2 the difference between systems 3 and 4 is in that feature selection precedes active learning in the former , and the best feature subset is picked in a retrospective manner , while it follows active learning in the latter .
we then move on to discuss a real system which employs a two-tiered approach of document feedback and feature feedback like the system in figure 2 which we evaluate using a simulation : we obtain feedback on features and documents apriori , and use the judgments so obtained to measure the effectiveness of our approach .
budgeted learning also works on identifying the predictive features during an active learning setting , but in this case the feature values are unknown and there is a cost to finding each feature s value for each instance of interest -LRB- such as the outcome of blood test on an individual -RRB- -LRB- lizotte et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
