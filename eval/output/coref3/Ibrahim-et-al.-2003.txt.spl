based on aligned monolingual corpora , our technique for extracting paraphrases builds on lin and pantels insight of using dependency paths -LRB- derived from parsing -RRB- as the fundamental unit of learning and using parts of those paths as features .
sentence alignment was performed using the gale and church algorithm -LRB- 1991 -RRB- with the following cost function : to test the accuracy of our alignment , we manually aligned 454 sentences from two
using the approach described in previous sections , we were able to extract nearly six thousand different paraphrases -LRB- see table 1 -RRB- from our corpus , which consisted of two translations of 20,000 leagues under the sea , two translations of the kreutzer sonata , and three translations of madame bouvary .
6 paraphrases and question answering the ultimate goal of our work on paraphrases is to enable the development of high-precision question answering system -LRB- cf .
the problems associated with keyword query expansion techniques stem from the fundamental deficiencies of bag-of-words approaches ; in short , they simply can not accurately model the semantic content of text , as illustrated by the following pairs of sentences and phrases that have the same word content , but dramatically different meaning : the above examples are nearly indistinguishable in terms of lexical content , yet their meanings are vastly different .
