the processing of comparative expressions such as -LRB- 1 -RRB- and -LRB- 2 -RRB- was incorporated into an existing system , semrep -LSB- rindflesch and fiszman , 2003 ; rindflesch et al. , 2005 -RSB- , which constructs semantic predications by mapping assertions in biomedical text to the unified medical language system -LRB- umls -RRB- -LSB- humphreys et al. , 1998 -RSB- .
an adjective or noun is used to denote the scale , and words such as than , as , with , and to serve as cues to
5 discussion in examining semrep errors , we determined that more than 60 % of the false negatives -LRB- for both comp1 and comp2 -RRB- were due to empty heads -LSB- chodorow et al. , 1985 ; guthrie et al. , 1990 -RSB- , in which the syntactic head of a noun phrase does not reflect semantic thrust .
although , in this paper , we tested the method on structures in which the compared terms belong to the semantic group chemicals &amp; drugs , we can straightforwardly generalize the method by adding other semantic groups to the algorithm .
we suggest one example of an application that can benefit from the information provided by the knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation of comparative structures , and that is the interpretation of outcome statements in medline citations , as a method for supporting automatic access to the latest results from clinical trials research .
