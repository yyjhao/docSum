researchers have already investigated issues such as identifying repetitions or contradictions across input documents and determining which information is salient enough to include in the summary -LRB- barzilay , mckeown , &amp; elhadad , 1999 ; carbonell &amp; goldstein , 1998 ; elhadad &amp; mckeown , 2001 ; mani &amp; bloedorn , 1997 ; mckeown , klavans , hatzivassiloglou , barzilay , &amp; eskin , 1999 ; radev &amp; mckeown , 1998 ; white , korelsky , cardie , ng , pierce , &amp; wagstaff , 2001 -RRB- .
given that there are multiple possible orderings , a corpus providing one ordering for each set of information does not allow us to differentiate between sentences which must be together and sentences which happen to be together .
our evaluation of plausible strategies measured the usefulness of a chronological ordering algorithm used in previous summarization systems -LRB- mckeown et al. , 1999 ; lin &amp; hovy , 2001 -RRB- as well as an alternative , original strategy , majority ordering .
to actually identify a possible impact of ordering on comprehension , we selected only summaries where humans judged the ordering as poor .3 for each summary , we manually reordered the sentences generated by the summarizer , using the input articles as a reference .
figure 12 shows how the augmented algorithm improves the sentence order compared with the order in the summary produced by the co algorithm in figure 9 ; sentences quoting us officials are now grouped together , and so
