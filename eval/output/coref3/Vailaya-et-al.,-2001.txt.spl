the best classification accuracies achieved for each of the classifiers were 95.9 % for the city \/ landscape classifier -LRB- on
1 -LRB- b -RRB- shows the top-ten retrieved images -LRB- based on color histogram features -RRB- from a database of 2145 images of city and landscape scenes , for the query in fig .
based on the above observations , we use edge direction features -LRB- histograms and coherence vectors -RRB- for city \/ landscape classification and color features -LRB- histograms , coherence vectors , and spatial moments -RRB- in and color space for further classification of landscape images -LSB- 25 -RSB- , -LSB- 38 -RSB- , -LSB- 42 -RSB- .
the main reasons for the misclassification of outdoor images are 1 -RRB- uniform lighting on the image mostly as a result of a close-up shot and 2 -RRB- low-contrast images -LRB- several of the indoor images used in the training set were low contrast digital images and hence most low contrast outdoor images were classified as indoor scenes -RRB- .
this approach has the following advantages : small number of codebook vectors represent a particular class of images , regardless of the size of the training set ; it naturally allows for the integration of multiple features through the class-conditional densities ; it not only provides a classification rule , but also assigns a degree of confidence in the classification , which may be used to build a reject option .
