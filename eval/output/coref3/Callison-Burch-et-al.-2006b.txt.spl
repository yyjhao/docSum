we augmented the baseline model by incorporating the paraphrase probability into an additional feature function which assigns values as follows
we evaluated the efficacy of using paraphrases in three ways : by calculating the bleu score for the translated output , by measuring the increase in coverage when including paraphrases , and through a targeted manual evaluation of the phrasal translations of unseen phrases to determine how many of the newly covered phrases were accurately translated .
we produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora : a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities , and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities .
for those items judged to have the same meaning as the gold standard phrases we could track how many would have contributed to a higher bleu score -LRB- that is , which of them were exactly the same as the reference translation phrase , or had some words in common with the reference translation phrase -RRB- .
