note that because we are concerned with the semantic relations that hold between the concepts , as opposed to the more standard , syntax-driven computational goal of determining left versus right association , this has the fortuitous effect of changing the problem into one of classification , amenable to standard machine learning classification techniques .
we use the metathesaurus component to map lexical items into
for these experiments , we considered only those noun compounds for which both nouns can be mapped into mesh terms , resulting in a total of 2245 ncs .
other words in the test set for 14 are varicella which is present in the trainig set only in varicella serology labeled as attribute of clinical study , drainage which is in the training set only as location -LRB- gallbladder drainage and tract drainage -RRB- and activity -LRB- bile drainage -RRB- .
it is interesting to note that the accuracy for case 1 -LRB- first noun not present in the training set -RRB- is much higher than the accuracy for case 2 -LRB- second noun not present in the training set -RRB- .
these results can be compared with vanderwende note that for unseen words , the baseline lexical-based logistic regression approach , which essentially builds a tabular representation of the log-odds for each class , also reduces to random guessing .
