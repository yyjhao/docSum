based on a series of experiments over the past two years -LSB- 5,6 -RSB- we have developed the following procedure for acquiring semantic patterns from a text corpus : generalizing semantic patterns .
co-occurrence smoothing is a method which has been recently proposed for smoothing n-gram models -LSB- 3 -RSB- .3 the core of this method involves the computation of a co-occurrence matrix -LRB- a matrix of confusion probabilities -RRB- pc -LRB- wilivi -RRB- , which indicates the probability of word wi occurring in contexts in which word wi occurs , averaged over these contexts .
is the result of an incorrect parse -RRB- , we apply a filter in generating pc : for i j , we generate a non-zero pc -LRB- wilwi -RRB- only if the wi and wj appear in at least two common contexts , and there is some common context in which both words occur at least twice .
we began by generating triples from the entire corpus and evaluating the selectional patterns as described above ; the resulting recall \/ precision curve generated by varying the threshold is shown in figure 1 .
to see how pattern
we have also demonstrated that for a given corpus size coverage can be significantly improved by using the corpus to identify selectionally related terms , and using these similarities to generalize the patterns observed in the training corpus .
