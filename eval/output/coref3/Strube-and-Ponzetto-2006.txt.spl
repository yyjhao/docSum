semantic relatedness measures are used in many applications in natural language processing -LRB- nlp -RRB- such as word sense disambiguation -LRB- patwardhan et al. , 2005 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 -RRB- , interpretation of noun compounds -LRB- kim &amp; baldwin , 2005 -RRB- and spelling correction -LRB- budanitsky &amp; hirst , 2006 -RRB- .
leacock &amp; chodorow -LRB- 1998 , lch -RRB- propose a normalized path-length measure which takes into account the depth of the taxonomy in which the concepts are found where length -LRB- c1 , c2 -RRB- is the number of nodes along the shortest path between the two nodes -LRB- as given by the edge counting method -RRB- , and d is the maximum depth of the taxonomy .
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path-based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
we evaluated the relatedness measures on three standard datasets , namely miller &amp; charles -LRB- 1991 -RRB- list of
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
