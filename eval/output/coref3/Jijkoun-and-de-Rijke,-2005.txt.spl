in this paper we describe a simple system based on lexical similarity , with two different word similarity measures .
for example , for positive decisions -LRB- sim ^ threshold -RRB- : the algorithm is parametrized with two functions : weight -LRB- w -RRB- : importance of the word for the similarity identification ; wordsim -LRB- w1 , w2 -RRB- : similarity between two words , with range -LSB- 0 , 1 -RSB- .
it is not clear whether this is due to the test corpus being more difficult , or our system overfits the development corpus in ways other than threshold selection .
moreover , whereas the difference between the two similarity measures seems substantial
manual examination of the entailment candidate pairs from the cd subtask shows that the pairs usually have many words in common : in the second example the similarity is substantially lower since numbers -LRB- which occur relatively rarely in our newspaper collection , and thus get higher weight -RRB- are different .
although , in principle , we can tune the precision \/ recall balance by varying the thresholds , the experimental results on which we report in this note show that the thresholds are very corpus-specific and thus can hardly be used for this tuning .
we described our participation in the pascal-2005 recognizing textual entailment challenge , with a simple sentence similarity-based system that uses two different word similarity measures .
