importance of using both the features that test individual entities in the candidate pairs -LRB- entity features -RRB- , and the features that relate the entities inside pairs to each other -LRB- relation features -RRB- .
we compare several clustering algorithms , and several feature extraction and selection methods , evaluating them using a novel evaluation metric , which is adapted for evaluating precision-oriented uri clustering results .
the uri process consists of three main stages : -LRB- 1 -RRB- feature extraction representing the candidates as vectors in some feature space , -LRB- 2 -RRB- clustering of vectors , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- pruning of the resulting clusters .
we have presented the results of several experiments , comparing different clustering algorithms and different feature extraction and selection methods for unsupervised relation identification , using an evaluation metric adapted for the task .
in our experiments we surprisingly found that the single linkage hac not only outperforms both the hac with other linkage types and the k-means , but also has a natural stopping criterion : stop merging the clusters when the average similarity between the datapoints of the clusters being merged becomes smaller than ^ times the maximal similarity between them , where ^ &lt; 1 is a constant , for which we use 1 \/ 2 .
in table 5 we show further details for several top clusters : we list two candidate
