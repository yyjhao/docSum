measures of attributional similarity have been studied extensively , due to their applications in problems such as recognizing synonyms -LRB- landauer and dumais , 1997 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- deerwester et al. , 1990 -RRB- , determining semantic orientation -LRB- turney , 2002 -RRB- , grading student essays -LRB- rehder et al. , 1998 -RRB- , measuring textual cohesion -LRB- morris and hirst , 1991 -RRB- , and word sense disambiguation -LRB- lesk , 1986 -RRB- .
the performance
as mentioned in the introduction , lra extends the vsm approach of turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- by -LRB- 1 -RRB- exploring variations on the analogies by replacing words with synonyms -LRB- step 1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- automatically generating connecting patterns -LRB- step 4 -RRB- , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- smoothing the data with svd -LRB- step 9 -RRB- .
the novelty in turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; berland and charniak , 1999 -RRB- ; instead , they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words .
the single nearest neighbor algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -LRB- i.e. , it requires a training set of labeled data -RRB- , but we are using lra to measure the distance between a pair and its potential neighbors , and lra is itself determined in an unsupervised fashion -LRB- i.e. , lra does not need labeled data -RRB- .
