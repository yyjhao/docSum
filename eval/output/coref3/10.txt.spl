the chief contribution of this paper is to introduce a new probabilistic model for clustering that outperforms standard unsupervised clustering in our experiments , and that also can accomodate a variety of
one commonly used probabilistic model for text clustering is the multinomial naive bayes model described in -LSB- 11 -RSB- , which models a document as a vector of words with each word generated independently by a multinomial probability distribution conditioned on the document s class -LRB- i.e. , conditioned on which cluster it belongs to -RRB- .
the key difference between the standard model and our speclustering model is that our model assumes each document is generated by a mixture of two multinomials -LCB- one associated with the document s cluster , and the other shared across all clusters .
the simple method inherits previous clustering results which the user gives her feedback upon and for removed clusters , we reset the initial value of p -LRB- si1di ; bt -RRB- by distributing the probability mass uniformly among all clusters and halving the probability for the cluster s. the joint method uses feedback jointly to initialize the model .
all 5 runs with cr or pp feedback , 4 runs with wx feedback and 3 runs with hx feedback outperform both naive bayes baseline and speclustering-bound without feedback .
