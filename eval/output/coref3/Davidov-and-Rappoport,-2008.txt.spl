studying relationships between tagged named entities , -LRB- hasegawa et al. , 2004 ; hassan et al. , 2006 -RRB- proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given sets of pairs into several clusters , where each cluster corresponds to one of a known set of relationship types .
unlike most previous work , our hook words are not provided in advance but selected randomly ; the goal in those papers is to discover relationships between given word pairs , while we use hook words in order to discover relationships that generally occur in the corpus .
to avoid the selection of common words as target words , and to avoid targets appearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed multiword expressions , we sort all target words in a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual information between hook and target , and drop patterns obtained from pattern instances containing the lowest and highest l percent of target words .
we merge clusters from different hook corpora using the following algorithm : we start from the smallest clusters because we expect these to be more precise ; the best patterns for semantic acquisition are those that belong to small clusters , and appear in many different clusters .
in our experiments we have used the following values -LRB- again , determined using a development set
