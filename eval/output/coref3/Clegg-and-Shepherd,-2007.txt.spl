the software packages used in our evaluation are the bikel parser -LSB- 15 -RSB- , the collins parser -LSB- 16 -RSB- , the stanford parser -LSB- 17,18 -RSB- and the charniak parser -LSB- 19 -RSB- including a modified version known herein as the charniak-lease parser -LSB- 20 -RSB- .
our gold standard corpus was 1757 sentences from the genia treebank -LSB- 13 -RSB- , which were mapped from their original tree structures to dependency graphs by the same deterministic algorithm from the stanford toolkit that we used to convert the output of each parser -LSB- 9 -RSB- .
that said , there is more information
the stanford parser has been used to provide syntactic clues for identifying key clinical terms in the medical domain -LSB- 34 -RSB- and gene and protein names in the biological domain -LSB- 35 -RSB- , although we disagree with the latter paper that unlexicalised parsers those that represent words simply by their pos tags are more suited to the biological domain than lexicalised parsers equipped with a general-english lexicon .
the stanford algorithm provides a de facto standard for comparing a variety of constituent parsers and treebanks at the dependency level ; if the dependency parser community were to adopt the same set of grammatical relations as standard , then native dependency parsers could be compared to constituent parsers and to biological treebanks fairly and transparently .
