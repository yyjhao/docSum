the overall approach of grenager et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- typifies the process involved in fully unsupervised learning on new domain : they first alter the structure of their hmm so that diagonal transitions are preferred , then modify the transition structure to explicitly model boundary tokens , and so on .
we automatically extracted the prototype list by taking our data and selecting for each annotated label the top three occurring word types which were not given another label more often .
each prototype word is also its own prototype -LRB- since a word has maximum similarity to itself -RRB- , so when we lock the prototype to a label , we are also pushing all the words distributionally similar to that prototype towards that label .
an important characteristic of this domain -LRB- see figure 1 -LRB- a -RRB- -RRB- is that the hidden labels tend to be sticky , in that fields tend to consist of runs of the same label , as in figure 1 -LRB- c -RRB- , in contrast with part-of-speech tagging , where we rarely see adjacent tokens given the same label .
adding distributional similarity fea tures to our model -LRB- proto + sim -RRB- improves accuracy substantially , yielding 71.5 % , a 38.4 % error reduction over base .6 another feature of this domain that grenager et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- take advantage of is that end of
