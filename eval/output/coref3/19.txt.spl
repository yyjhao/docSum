the prototype described in this paper includes changes to the four processing components in the javelin pipeline : question analyzer : this component , which formerly produced just question keywords , question type and answer type for each question , is extended to provide key predicates as well .
for the prototype system we decribe here , a new component is created which takes the key predicates as input , as well as a set of documents provided by the retrieval strategist which contain predicate instances that match the key predicates , and entity mentions of interest .
the actual sentences that gave rise to these facts are shown below , with the mentioned chemical weapons in italics , and the filename of the original cns corpus document given in parentheses for each sentence : the ix also found facts about egypts delivery of chemical weapons to third parties , and egypts battlefield use of such weapons , both of which might satisfy the information need with the help of some inference .
in this paper , we described a set of extensions to the javelin qa system which support the use of domain semantics -LRB- ontologies and semantic annotations -RRB- for question answering that is based on key predicates and fact matching , rather than keywords and string matching .
