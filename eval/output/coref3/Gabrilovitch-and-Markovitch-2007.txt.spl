however , prior work on semantic relatedness was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge -LSB- baeza-yates and ribeiro-neto , 1999 ; deerwester et al. , 1990 -RSB- , or on lexical resources that incorporate very limited knowledge about the world -LSB- budanitsky and hirst , 2006 ; jarmasz , 2003 -RSB- .
we use machine learning techniques to build a semantic interpreter that maps fragments of natural language text into a weighted sequence of wikipedia concepts ordered by their relevance to the input .

we processed the text of these articles by removing stop words and rare words , and stemming the remaining words ; this yielded 389,202 distinct terms , which served for representing wikipedia concepts as attribute vectors .
prior work in the field pursued three main directions : comparing text fragments as bags of words in vector space -LSB- baeza-yates and ribeiro-neto , 1999 -RSB- , using lexical resources , and using latent semantic analysis -LRB- lsa -RRB- -LSB- deer - wester et al. , 1990 -RSB- .
finally , even for individual words , esa provides much more sophisticated mapping of words to concepts , through the analysis of the large bodies of texts associated with concepts .
on the other hand , our approach represents each word as a weighted vector of wikipedia concepts , and semantic relatedness is then computed by comparing the two concept vectors .
