in the mid-1990s , kautz and selman developed a social network extraction system from the web , called referral web -LSB- 21 -RSB- .
some particular social networks on the web have been investigated in detail : l. adamic has classified the social network at stanford and mit students , and has collected relations among students from web link structure and text information -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
therefore , the difference of hits by two names shows the bias of co-occurrence of the two names : yutaka matsuo is likely to appear in web pages with peter mika than lada adamic .
the number of queries to a search engine becomes a problem when we apply extraction of a social network to a large-scale community : a network with 1000 nodes requires 500,000 queries and grows with o -LRB- n2 -RRB- , where n is the number of persons .
various types of retrieval are possible on the social network : researchers can be sought by name , affiliation , keyword , and research field ; related researchers to a retrieved researcher are listed ; and a search for the shortest path between two researchers can be made .
such feedback from an extracted network to individual relations is
following that concept , we propose a new architecture to extract a social network from the web , called super social network mining .
