potential applications of social networks in information systems are presented in -LSB- 43 -RSB- : examples include viral marketing through social networks -LRB- also see -LSB- 24 -RSB- -RRB- and e-mail filtering based on social networks .
in the mid-1990s , kautz and selman developed a social network extraction system from the web , called referral web -LSB- 21 -RSB- .
some particular social networks on the web have been investigated in detail : l. adamic has classified the social network at stanford and mit students , and has collected relations among students from web link structure and text information -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
several indices can measure the co-occurrence -LSB- 29 -RSB- : matching coefficient , nxny ; mutual information , log -LRB- nnxny \/ nxny -RRB- ; dice coefficient , -LRB- 2nxny -RRB- \/ -LRB- nx + ny -RRB- ; jaccard coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ nxvy -RRB- ; overlap coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ min -LRB- nx , ny -RRB- -RRB- ; and cosine , -LRB- nxny \/ v \/ nxny -RRB- ; where nx and ny denote the respective hit counts of name x and y , and nxny and nxvy denote the respective hit counts of x and y and x or y. depending on the co-occurrence measure that is used , the resultant social network varies .
the number of queries to a search engine becomes a problem when we apply extraction of a social network to a large-scale community : a network with 1000 nodes requires 500,000 queries and grows with o -LRB- n2 -RRB- , where n is the number of persons .
