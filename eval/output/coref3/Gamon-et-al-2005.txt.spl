the other category was applied to sentences with no discernible sentiment , as well as to sentences that expressed both positive and negative sentiment and sentences with sentiment that can not be deduced without taking context and \/ or world knowledge into account .
once the sentences for a make and model of car have been assigned to clusters and have received a sentiment score from the sentiment classifier , the visualization component -LRB- section 3.1 -RRB- displays the clusters and the keyword labels that were produced for the sentences associated with that car .
we experimented with several different clustering algorithms for finding salient patterns in the sentences : a k-means clustering algorithm using tf idf vectors , as described in -LSB- 6 -RSB- , an em implementation of
the latter category includes sentences with no discernible sentiment -LRB- a sentiment-neutral description of a model , for example -RRB- , sentences with balanced sentiment -LRB- where both a positive and a negative opinion are expressed within the same sentence -RRB- , and sentences with a sentiment that can only be detected by taking the review context and \/ or world knowledge into account .
the data set shows a clear skew towards positive reviews : in the annotated data set , positive sentences comprise 62.33 % of the data , sentences of type other comprise 23.27 % , and negative sentences 14.4 % .
