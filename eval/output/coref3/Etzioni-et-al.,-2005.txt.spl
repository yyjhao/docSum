the assessor computes the pmi between each extracted instance and multiple , automatically generated discriminator phrases associated with the class -LRB- such as x is a city for the class city -RRB- .4 for
the query yield varies greatly depending on the predicate and the extraction method used : the query yield for learned rules tends to be lower than for rules from generic patterns ; the list extractor method , where one query can produces a hundred extractions or more , has much higher query yield than the other knowitall extraction methods .
experiments 10 , 11 , and 12 compare the number of extractions at two precision levels : at precision 0.90 for the baseline knowitall system -LRB- b -RRB- , the baseline combined with each method -LRB- pl , se , le -RRB- and all for the union of instances extracted by b , pl , se , and le ; and at precision .80 for the bars marked b2 , pl2 , se2 , le2 , and all2 .
while its generic extraction patterns are specific to english , knowitall could bootstrap its way into other languages by using the patterns to learn instances of a class -LRB- e.g. , cities in france -RRB- and then use its pattern learning module to learn extraction rules and discriminators in french , which may be particularly effective at extracting the names of french cities .
