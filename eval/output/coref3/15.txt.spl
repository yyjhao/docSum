in the first text snippet the distance between the candidate answer 1890 and all the question keywords -LRB- idaho , became and state -RRB- is 0 , since only stop-words are present between the candidate answer and the question keywords .
for instance , if the validation statement is the capital of usa is washington , we have web documents containing passages like those reported in table 1 , which can not be found with a simple search of
compute the set of representative keywords and both from and from , this step is carried out using linguistic techniques , such as answer type identification -LRB- from the question -RRB- and named entities recognition -LRB- from the answer -RRB- ; from the extracted keywords compute the validation pattern for the pair ; submit the validation pattern to a search engine ; estimate an answer relevance score -LRB- ars -RRB- considering the results returned by the search engine .
the retrieved documents are then used for determine an answer validation score as the composition of two alternative answer validation techniques , namely a statistical approach and a content-based approach .
the statistical approach relies on the hypothesis that the number of documents retrieved from the web in which the question and the answer co-occur can be considered a significant clue to the validity of the answer .
