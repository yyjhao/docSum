semantic relatedness measures are used in many applications in natural language processing -LRB- nlp -RRB- such as word sense disambiguation -LRB- patwardhan et al. , 2005 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 -RRB- , interpretation of noun compounds -LRB- kim &amp; baldwin , 2005 -RRB- and spelling correction -LRB- budanitsky &amp; hirst , 2006 -RRB- .
wikipedia mining works in our system as follows : given the word pairs i , j -LRB- king and rook for instance -RRB- we first retrieve
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path - based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
we evaluated the relatedness measures on three standard datasets , namely miller &amp; charles -LRB- 1991 -RRB- list of 30 noun pairs -LRB- m &amp; c -RRB- , the 65 word synonymity list from rubenstein &amp; goodenough -LRB- 1965 , r &amp; g -RRB- of which m &amp; c is a subset , and finally the wordsimilarity-353 test collection -LRB- finkelstein et al. , 2002 , 353-tc -RRB- 3 .
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
