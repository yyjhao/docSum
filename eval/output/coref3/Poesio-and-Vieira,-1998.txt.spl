for these reasons we chose hawkins list of
this class , that we will call larger situation \/ unfamiliar , includes both definite descriptions that exploit situational information -LRB- hawkins larger situation uses -RRB- and discourse - new definite descriptions introduced together with their links or referents -LRB- unfamiliar -RRB- .
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
a definite description may rely on specific knowledge about the larger situation : this is the case in which both the speaker and the hearer know about the existence of the referent , as in the example below , in which it is assumed that speaker and hearer are both inhabitants of halifax , a town which has a gibbet at the top of gibbet street : specific knowledge is not , however , a necessary part of the meaning of larger situation uses of definite descriptions .
