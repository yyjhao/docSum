the semeval 2007 task on semantic relations between nominals is to identify the underlying semantic relation between two nouns in the context of a sentence .
we selected a list of 18 lexico-syntactic and semantic features split here into three sets : feature set # 1 -LRB- core features -RRB- , feature set # 2 -LRB- context features -RRB- , and the feature set # 3 -LRB- special features -RRB- .
furthermore , we implemented and used two semantic role features which identify the semantic
the instrument semantic role is used for the instrument - agency relation as a boolean feature -LRB- f17 -RRB- indicating whether the argument identified as instrument in the relation -LRB- e.g. , e1 if instrumentagency -LRB- e1 , e2 -RRB- -RRB- belongs to an instrument phrase as identified by a semantic role tool , such as assert .
the syntactic attachment feature -LRB- f18 -RRB- is a feature that indicates whether the argument identified as instrument in the relation attaches to a verb or to a noun in the syntactically parsed sentence .
besides the selectional restrictions imposed on the nouns by special features such as f15 and f16 -LRB- psychological feature -RRB- , we created lists of containers from various thesauri6 and identified selectional restrictions that differentiate between containers and locations relying on taxonomies of spatial entities discussed in detail in -LRB- herskovits , 1987 -RRB- and -LRB- tyler and evans , 2003 -RRB- .
