given a small amount of labeled data and a large unlabeled pool , our framework initializes the model with the labeled data and then repeatedly : uses constraints and the learned model to label the instances in the pool .
5 learning and inference with constraints in this section we present a new constraint-driven learning algorithm -LRB- codl -RRB- for using constraints to guide semi-supervised learning .
the fact that the constraints are used in the inference procedure -LRB- in particular , for generating new training examples -RRB- allows us to use a learning algorithm that ignores the constraints , which is a lot more efficient -LRB- although algorithms that do take the constraints into account can be used too -RRB- .
figure 3 compares two protocols on the advertisements domain : h &amp; w + i , where we first run the h &amp; w protocol and then apply the constraints during testing stage , and h &amp; w &amp; c + i , which uses constraints to guide the model during learning and uses it also in testing .
although
the results show that constraints improve not only the performance of the final inference stage but also propagate useful information during the semi - supervised learning process and that training with the constraints is especially significant when the number of labeled training data is small .
