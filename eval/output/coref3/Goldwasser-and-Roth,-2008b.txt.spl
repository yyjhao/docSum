once the training data has been collected , the data is analyzed to identify repeating patterns in the data which are used to focus the training process by assigning weights to features corresponding to the
the remainder of this section provides details about these stages ; the basic formulation of the transliteration model and the feature extraction scheme is described in section 2.1 , in section 2.2 the selective sampling process is described and finally section 2.3 explains how learning is focused by using feature weights .
our transliteration model takes a discriminative approach ; the classifier is presented with a word pair -LRB- ws , wt -RRB- , where ws is a named entity and it is asked to determine whether wt is a transliteration of the ne in the target language .
in this paper we presented a new approach for constructing a transliteration model automatically and efficiently by selectively extracting transliteration samples covering relevant parts of the feature space and focusing the learning process on these features .
another aspect investigated is using our selective sampling for adapting the learning process for data originating from different sources using the a reference set representative of the testing data , training samples , originating from a different source , can be biased towards the testing data .
