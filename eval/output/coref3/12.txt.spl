the goal is to determine how many different people are represented for that name in the input web pages , and correctly assign each namesake to its corresponding subset of web pages .
we used the meurlin system -LRB- kan and nguyen thi , 2005 -RRB- to segment the url of each web page into tokens as well as to
these features include -LRB- a -RRB- segmentation of tokens such as www.allposters.com to www , all , posters and com ; -LRB- b -RRB- the parts in the url where the tokens occur , e.g. , protocol , domain name , and directory paths ; -LRB- c -RRB- length of the tokens ; -LRB- d -RRB- orthographic features ; -LRB- e -RRB- sequential n-grams ; and -LRB- f -RRB- sequential bigrams .
among the individual features , tokens and named entity features consistently show close to best performance for all training data sets .
using a web pages url itself in the features host + self and domain + self shows a larger increase in inverse purity at a smaller decrease in purity , hence these have improved f-measure in comparison to domain and host .
while the features generated by meurlin do improve the performance over pure host name and domain on the page urls , its incorporation in a richer feature set does not lead to better results , as the other features which have richer information to process .
