we introduce a novel approach for this problem : use paraphrases posed against an enormous text collection as a way to determine which predicates , represented as verbs , best characterize the relationship between the nouns .
what is especially novel about this approach is paraphrasing noun compound semantics in terms of concrete verbs , rather than a fixed number of abstract predicates -LRB- e.g. , have , make , use -RRB- , relations -LRB- e.g. , location , instrument , agent -RRB- , or prepositions -LRB- e.g. , of , for , in -RRB- , as is traditional in the literature .
there is currently no consensus as to which set of relations should hold between nouns in a noun compound , but most existing approaches make use of a set of a small number of abstract relations , typically less than 50 .
in later work , -LSB- 9 -RSB- provide a semi-supervised approach for characterizing the relation between two nouns in a bioscience noun-noun compound based on the semantic category each of the constituent nouns belongs to .
our idea is to preserve the head - modifier relation by substituting the pre-modifier noun , with a suitable post - modifying relative phrase ; e.g. , tear gas can be transformed into gas that causes tears , gas that brings tears , gas which produces tears , etc .
we will also assess the results against a larger collection of manually labeled relations , and have
