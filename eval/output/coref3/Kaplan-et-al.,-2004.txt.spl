performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
the xle system achieves 12 % reduction in error rate over the collins parser , that is 77.6 % f-score for the xle system versus 74.6 % for the collins parser , at a cost in parsing time of a factor of 1.49 .
however , a certain amount of skill and intuition was required to provide a fair conversion of the collins trees : we did not want to penalize configurations in the collins trees that encoded alternative but equally legitimate representations of the same linguistic properties -LRB- e.g. whether auxiliaries are encoded as main verbs or aspect features -RRB- , but we also did not want to build into the
we avoided the temptation of building coordinate distribution into the conversion routine because , first , it is not always obvious from the model 3 output when distribution should take place , and second , that would be a first step towards building into the conversion routine the deep lexical and syntactic knowledge -LRB- essentially the functional component of our lfg grammar -RRB- that the shallow approach explicitly discounts .
