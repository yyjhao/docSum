note that because we are concerned with the semantic relations that hold between the concepts , as opposed to the more standard , syntax-driven computational goal of determining left versus right association , this has the fortuitous effect of changing the problem into one of classification , amenable to standard machine learning classification techniques .
for these experiments , we considered only those noun compounds for which both
other words in the test set for 14 are varicella which is present in the trainig set only in varicella serology labeled as attribute of clinical study , drainage which is in the training set only as location -LRB- gallbladder drainage and tract drainage -RRB- and activity -LRB- bile drainage -RRB- .
therefore , we split the data into 5 % training -LRB- 73 data points -RRB- and 95 % testing -LRB- 1587 data points -RRB- and partitioned the testing set into 4 subsets as follows -LRB- the numbers in parentheses are the numbers of points for each case -RRB- : figure 4 shows the accuracy for the mesh based - model for the the four cases of table 5 .
it is interesting to note that the accuracy for case 1 -LRB- first noun not present in the training set -RRB- is much higher than the accuracy for case 2 -LRB- second noun not present in the training set -RRB- .
