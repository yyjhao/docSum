because we use the same data as turney &amp; littman -LRB- 2003 -RRB- and
the data we use consist of 600 noun-modifier pairs , tagged with 30 semantic relations , grouped into 5 classes of relations by general similarity -LRB- barker 1998 -RRB- , -LRB- nastase &amp; szpakowicz 2003 -RRB- , -LRB- turney &amp; littman 2003 -RRB- : the words in the pairs from the dataset are also annotated with part of speech and wordnet 1.6 word senses .
to compare these paraphrase - based representations with the corpus-based and wordnetbased ones , table 1 includes the results obtained using wordnet with word sense information and without and word sketches in methodologically similar experiments using an instance-based learner -LRB- timbl v. 5.1.0 -LRB- daelemans et al. 2004 -RRB- -RRB- , with 2 nearest neighbor and leave-one-out testing .
moreover , the difference in results when using word sketches and when using non-annotated data in favor of word sketches indicate that when no word-sense information is available , corpus-based word descriptions are more informative and useful for the task of learning semantic relations .
looking at the results obtained with the different representation methods , we can conclude that we can detect successfully the temporal relation between words by looking at either of the following : individual word senses as described by wordnet , word meaning as described by its contexts , or the prepositions or paraphrases that connect the words in the pair .
