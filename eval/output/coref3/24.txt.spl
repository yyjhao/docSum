a growing number of statistical classification methods and machine learning techniques have been applied to text categorization in recent years , including multivariate regression models -LSB- 8 , 27 -RSB- , nearest neighbor classification -LSB- 4 , 23 -RSB- , bayes probabilistic approaches -LSB- 20 , 13 -RSB- , decision trees -LSB- 13 -RSB- , neural networks -LSB- 21 -RSB- , symbolic rule learning -LSB- 1 , 16 , 3 -RSB- and inductive learning algorithms -LSB- 3 , 12 -RSB- .
using the two-way contingency table of a term t and a category c , where a is the number of times t and c co-occur , b is the number of time the t occurs without c , c is the number of times c occurs without
in a recent evaluation of classification methods -LSB- 26 -RSB- on the reuters newswire collection -LRB- next section -RRB- , the break-even point values were 85 % for both knn and llsf , outperforming all the other systems evaluated on the same collection , including symbolic rule learning by ripper -LRB- 80 % -RRB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- , swap - 1 -LRB- 79 % -RRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- and charade -LRB- 78 % -RRB- -LSB- 16 -RSB- , a decision approach using c4 .5 -LRB- 79 % -RRB- -LSB- 15 -RSB- , inductive learning by sleeping experts -LRB- 76 % -RRB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- , and a typical information retrieval approach named rocchio -LRB- 75 % -RRB- -LSB- 3 -RSB- .
4.3 primary results figure 1 displays the performance curves for knn on reuters -LRB- 9,610 training documents , and 3,662 test documents -RRB- after term selection using ig , df , ts , mi and chi thresholding , respectively .
