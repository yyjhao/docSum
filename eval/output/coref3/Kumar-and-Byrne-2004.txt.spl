this rapid progress has been greatly facilitated by the development of automatic translation evaluation metrics such as bleu score -LRB- papineni et al. , 2001 -RRB- , nist score -LRB- doddington , 2002 -RRB- and position independent word error rate -LRB- per -RRB- -LRB- och , 2002 -RRB- .
we apply the minimum bayes-risk -LRB- mbr -RRB- techniques developed for automatic speech recognition -LRB- goel and byrne , 2000 -RRB- and bitext word alignment for statistical mt -LRB- kumar and byrne , 2002 -RRB- , to the problem of building automatic mt systems tuned for specific metrics .
while string based metrics such as bleu , wer and per are insensitive to the syntactic structure of the translations , bitree loss is able to measure this aspect of translation quality , and assigns different scores to the two translations .
given an mt evaluation metric of interest such as bleu , per or wer , we can use this metric as a loss function within the mbr framework
we present results under the bitree loss function as an example of incorporating linguistic information into a loss function ; we have not yet measured its correlation with human assessments of translation quality .
while we have focused on developing mbr procedures for loss functions that measure various aspects of translation quality , this framework can also be used with loss functions which measure application-specific error criteria .
