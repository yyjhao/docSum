since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
a summary of phrase-level and sentence-level meronymic patterns along with their extensions and generalizations is provided in appendix a. based on our observations of the corpus used for the pattern identification procedure and based on the results obtained by others -LRB- evens et al. 1980 -RRB- , we have concluded that the
for each set of unambiguous positive and negative examples at each level in the downward descent , we apply quinlan-s c4 .5 algorithm and learn classification rules of the form if x is \/ is not of a wordnet semantic class a and y is \/ is not of wordnet semantic class b , then the instance is \/ is not a part-whole relation .
the set of rules represents the rules to be used for classifying the new instances and the default value represents the target value -LRB- yes if an instance is a part-whole relation and no if the instance is not a part-whole relation -RRB- that should be returned if none of the rules classify the new instances .
