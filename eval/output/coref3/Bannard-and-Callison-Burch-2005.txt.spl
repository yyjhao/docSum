much previous work on extracting paraphrases -LRB- barzilay and mckeown , 2001 ; barzilay and lee , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2003 -RRB- has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted , and treated as paraphrases .
since the best paraphrase may
we include a simple language model probability , which would additionally rank e2 based on the probability of the sentence formed by substiuting e2 for e1 in s. a possible extension which we do not evaluate might be permitting only paraphrases that are the same syntactic type as the original phrase , which we could do by extending the translation model probabilities to count only phrase occurrences of that type .
we evaluated the accuracy of top ranked paraphrases when the paraphrase probability was calculated using the manual alignments , the automatic alignments , automatic alignments produced over multiple corpora in different languages , all of the above with language model re-ranking , all of the above with the candidate paraphrases limited to the same sense as the original phrase .
for an evaluation set of 500 paraphrases , they report an average precision of 86 % at identifying paraphrases out of context , and of 91 % when the paraphrases are substituted into the original context of the aligned sentence .
