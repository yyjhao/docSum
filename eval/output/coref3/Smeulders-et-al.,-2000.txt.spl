a query falls in one of two major categories : exact query , where the query answer set a -LRB- q -RRB- equals the images in iq , satisfying a set of given criteria , and an approximate query , where a -LRB- q -RRB- is a ranking of the images in iq with respect to the query , based on sq .
5 interpretation and similarity when the information from images is captured in a feature set , there are two possibilities for endowing them with meaning : one derives an unilateral interpretation from the feature set , while the other one compares the feature set with the elements in a given data set on the basis of a similarity function , see fig .
in particular , the workshop correctly stated that '' visual information management systems should not be considered as an application of the existing state of the art -LRB- in computer vision and databases -RRB- to manage and process images '' and that '' computer vision researchers should identify features required for interactive image understanding , rather than their discipline 's current emphasis on automatic techniques '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- .
in this section , we discuss patterns in applications , the repertoire of images , the influence of the scene and the role of domain knowledge , and the semantic gap between image features and
