this compound disambiguation system -LRB- named pro , for proportional relation occurrence ; see costello , veale , &amp; dunne , 2006 -RRB- makes use of a corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with word - net senses and covering 139 different semantic relations , with each noun and each relation annotated with its correct wordnet sense .1 section 2 of the paper will describe the format and structure of this corpus , section 3 will describe the original pro compound disambiguation system , and section 4 will explain how the pro system was adapted to deduce the correct semantic relation between a pair of nominals , as in semeval task 4 .
the algorithm counts the number of times each relation occurs in that set of compounds , and assigns each relation a proportional relation occurrence -LRB- pro -RRB- score for that pair , equal to the conditional probability of relation r given sense-pair s. if the pro score for relation r in the current sense-pair is greater than the score obtained for r with some other pair , the current score is recorded for r. if the score for r for the current pair p is greater than any previous score obtained for p , that score is recorded for p. in this way the algorithm finds the maximum score for each relation r across all
