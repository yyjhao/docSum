since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
a summary of phrase-level and sentence-level meronymic patterns along with their extensions and generalizations is provided in appendix a. based on our observations of the corpus used for the pattern identification procedure and based on the results obtained by others -LRB- evens et al. 1980 -RRB- , we have
for each set of unambiguous positive and negative examples at each level in the downward descent , we apply quinlan-s c4 .5 algorithm and learn classification rules of the form if x is \/ is not of a wordnet semantic class a and y is \/ is not of wordnet semantic class b , then the instance is \/ is not a part-whole relation .
if there is no unambiguous node lu -LRB- and therefore default value du -RRB- , the default value for the first ambiguous example is propagated to l. for instance , for the ambiguous node 1.4.2 -LRB- social relation # 1-social relation # 1 -RRB- , there were no unambiguous examples ; and therefore the default value from the node 1.4.2.1 -LRB- written communication # 2 - written communication # 2 -RRB- will be used .
