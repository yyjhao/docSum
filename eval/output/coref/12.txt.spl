the goal is to determine how many different people are represented for that name in the input web pages , and correctly assign each namesake to its corresponding subset of web pages .
we found that larger values for these data sets do not allow the hac algorithm to create enough clustering hierarchy by causing it to terminate early , and therefore result in many small clusters increasing purity but dramatically suffering from inverse purity performance .
among the individual features , tokens and named entity features consistently show close to best performance for all training data sets .
using a web pages url itself in the features host + self and domain + self shows a larger increase in inverse purity at a smaller decrease in purity , hence these have improved f-measure in comparison to domain and host .
although the other two data sets may have popular people with many web pages , their web presence are usually created by others and often scatter across many
while the features generated by meurlin do improve the performance over pure host name and domain on the page urls , its incorporation in a richer feature set does not lead to better results , as the other features which have richer information to process .
