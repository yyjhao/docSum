we extracted sentences for developing comparative processing from a set of some 10,000 medline citations reporting on the results of clinical trials , a rich source of comparative structures .
in addition to identifying two compared terms when processing comp2 patterns
these were annotated with the pubmed id of the citation , names of two drugs -LRB- compared _ with predication -RRB- , the scale on which they are compared -LRB- scale -RRB- , and the relative position of the primary drug with respect to the secondary -LRB- same _ as , higher _ than , or lower _ than -RRB- .
in addition , correct identification of the comp2 structures depends on recognition of the scale on which the drugs are compared and the relative position of the drugs on the scale .
although , in this paper , we tested the method on structures in which the compared terms belong to the semantic group chemicals &amp; drugs , we can straightforwardly generalize the method by adding other semantic groups to the algorithm .
we suggest one example of an application that can benefit from the information provided by the knowledge inherent in the semantic interpretation of comparative structures , and that is the interpretation of outcome statements in medline citations , as a method for supporting automatic access to the latest results from clinical trials research .
