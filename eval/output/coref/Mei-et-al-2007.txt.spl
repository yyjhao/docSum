based on the concepts above , we define the major tasks of topic-sentiment analysis -LRB- tsa -RRB- on weblogs as : -LRB- 1 -RRB- learning general sentiment models : learn a sentiment model for positive opinions and a sentiment model for negative opinions , which are general enough to be used in new unlabeled collections .
-LRB- 2 -RRB- extracting topic models and sentiment coverages : given a collection of weblog articles and the general sentiment models learned , customize the sentiment models to this collection , extract the topic models , and extract the sentiment coverages .
correspondingly , we introduce four multinomial distributions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- bb is a background topic model to capture common english words ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- o = -LCB- b1 , , bki are k topic models to capture neutral descriptions about k global subtopics in the collection ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- bp is a positive sentiment model to capture positive opinions ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- bn is a negative sentiment model to capture negative opinions for all the topics in the collection .
in a very recent work -LSB- 4 -RSB- , the author proposed a topic dependent method for
with this model , we could effectively -LRB- 1 -RRB- learn general sentiment models ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- extract topic models orthogonal to sentiments , which can represent the neutral content of a subtopic ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- extract topic life cycles and the associated sentiment dynamics .
