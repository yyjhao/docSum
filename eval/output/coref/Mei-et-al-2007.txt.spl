in a very recent work -LSB- 4 -RSB- , the author proposed a topic dependent method for sentiment retrieval , which as - sumed that a sentence was generated from a probabilistic model consisting of both a topic language model and a sentiment language model .
with this model , we could effectively -LRB- 1 -RRB- learn general sentiment models ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- extract topic models orthogonal to sentiments , which can represent the neutral content of a subtopic ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- extract topic life cycles and the associated sentiment dynamics .
rather than directly using the learned sentiment models
correspondingly , we introduce four multinomial distributions : -LRB- 1 -RRB- bb is a background topic model to capture common english words ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- o = -LCB- b1 , , bki are k topic models to capture neutral descriptions about k global subtopics in the collection ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- bp is a positive sentiment model to capture positive opinions ; and -LRB- 4 -RRB- bn is a negative sentiment model to capture negative opinions for all the topics in the collection .
definition 5 -LRB- sentiment dynamics -RRB- the sentiment dynamics for a topic b is a time series representing the strength distribution of a sentiment s g -LCB- p , ni associated with b. the strength can indicate how much positive \/ negative opinion there is about the given topic in each time period .
