we consider a set v which consists of two types of variables v = e ^ r. the first set of variables e = -LCB- e1 , e2 , , en -RCB- ranges l. the value -LRB- called label -RRB- assigned to ei ^ e is denoted fe , ^ l. the second set of variables r = -LCB- rij -RCB- -LCB- 1 : 5i , j : 5n ; i ~ = j -RCB- is viewed as binary relations over e. specifically , for each pair of entities ei and ej , i = ~ j , we use rij and rji to denote the -LRB- binary -RRB- relations -LRB- ei , ej -RRB- and -LRB- ej , ei -RRB- respectively .
furthermore , it follows , as best as possible the recommendation of the entity and relation classifiers , but also satisfies natural constraints that exist on whether specific entities can be the argument of specific relations , whether two relations can occur together at the same time , or any other information that might be available at the inference time -LRB- e.g. , suppose it is known that entities a and b represent the same location ; one may like to incorporate an additional constraint that prevents an inference of the type : c lives in a ; c does not live in b -RRB- .
note that lp may change the predictions for either entity labels or relation labels , while pipeline fully trusts the labels of entity classifier , and only the
