given a list of pages obtained by submitting a person query to a search engine -LRB- i.e. msn in this study -RRB- , webhawk facilitates person search by re-organizing the search results in three steps : first of all , a filter removes junk pages that contain no person information .
for
the candidate sets for different types of personal information are produced as follows , respectively : person name candidates are those names which are extracted by the in-house ner tool and contain query terms ; organization candidates are all organizations extracted by the in-house ner tool ; title candidates are those terms co-occur both in the web page and in the person title gazetteer ; email address candidates are those substrings containing character @ ; phone number candidates are those substrings containing only numbers and hyphen and having at least 6 characters .
a junk page , in the context of person search , refers to a retrieved web page , with respect to a person query , where no occurrence of the person query in the page occurs as a -LRB- part of -RRB- person name .
we can simply extract the full names from web pages given person queries with three words , but the difficult case lies in the person queries composed of only one or two words -LRB- e.g. david and david lee -RRB- .
