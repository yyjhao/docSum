leacock &amp; chodorow -LRB- 1998 , lch -RRB- propose a normalized path-length measure which takes into account the depth of the taxonomy in which the concepts are found where length -LRB- c1 , c2 -RRB- is the number of nodes along the shortest path between the two nodes -LRB- as given by the edge counting method -RRB- , and d is the maximum depth of the taxonomy .
wikipedia mining works in our system as follows : given the word pairs i , j -LRB- king and rook for instance -RRB- we first retrieve the wikipedia pages which they refer to .
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path-based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
instead of integrating a word-vector based relatedness measure with a word - net based one , our results indicate that a competitive performance can be achieved also by
even if the taxonomic categorization feature has been introduced into wikipedia only two years ago , our results indicate that relatedness computed using the wikipedia taxonomy consistently correlates better with human judgements than a simple baseline based on google counts , and better than word - net for some datasets .
