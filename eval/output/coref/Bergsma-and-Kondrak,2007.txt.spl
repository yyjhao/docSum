if two words must have lcsr &gt; 0.58 to be cognate , then for a given word f e f , we need only consider as possible cognates the subset of words in e having an lcsr with f larger than 0.58 , a set we call ef .
to create training data for our learning approaches , and to generate a high-quality labeled test set , we need to annotate some of the -LRB- f , e f e ef -RRB- word pairs for whether or not the words share a common meaning .
thus one natural formulation for cognate identification is a pairwise -LRB- and symmetric -RRB- cognation classification that looks at each pair -LRB- f , e f -RRB- separately and individually makes a decision : in this formulation , the benefits of a discriminative approach are clear : it must find substrings that distinguish cognate pairs from word pairs with otherwise similar form .
for the dictionary-based cognate identification , we use french , spanish , german , greek
across all the test sets , this modification results in a 6 % average gain in performance over baseline kr , but is still on average 5 % below the alignment - based discriminative technique , with a statistically significantly difference on each of the nine sets .6 figure 2 shows the relationship between training data size and performance in our bitext-based french-english data .
