semantic similarity measures defined over snippets , have been used in query expansion -LSB- 36 -RSB- , personal name disambiguation -LSB- 4 -RSB- and community mining -LSB- 6 -RSB- .
semantic similarity measures have been used in semantic web related applications such as automatic annotation of web pages -LSB- 7 -RSB- , community mining -LSB- 23 , 19 -RSB- , and keyword extraction for inter-entity relation representation -LSB- 26 -RSB- .
one must consider the page counts not just for the query p and q , but also for the individual words p and q to assess semantic similarity between p and q. we modify four popular co-occurrence measures ; jaccard , overlap -LRB- simpson -RRB- , dice , and pmi -LRB- point-wise mutual information -RRB- , to compute semantic similarity using page counts .
we score the word pairs in miller-charles dataset using the page-count-based similarity scores defined in section 3.2 , web-based semantic similarity measures proposed in previous work -LRB- sahami -LSB- 36 -RSB- , chen -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- and the proposed method -LRB- semsim -RRB- .
disambiguating named entities is important in various applications such as information retrieval -LSB- 9 -RSB- , social network extraction -LSB- 19 , 3
we represent each snippet as a bag-of-words and calculate the similarity sim -LRB- sa , sb -RRB- between two snippets sa , sbas follows , in formula 15 isi denotes the number of words in snippet s. we used different semantic similarity measures for sim in formula 15 and employed the group average agglomerative clustering explained in section 4.7 .
