in our question answering system , piquant , we utilize
the candidate answers in these passages are identified and ranked based on three criteria : 1 -RRB- match in semantic type between candidate answer and expected answer , 2 -RRB- match in weighted grammatical relationships between question and answer passages , and 3 -RRB- frequency of answer in candidate passages -LRB- redundancy -RRB- .
at processing time , the statistical agent s answer type is mapped to the knowledge-based agent s classes -LRB- sa-types -RRB- , which are then merged with the answer type -LRB- s -RRB- selected by the knowledge-based agent itself -LRB- kba-types -RRB- as follows : if the intersection of kba-types and sa-types is non-null , i.e. , the two agents produced consistent answer types , then the merged set is kba-types .
third , passages from agent 2 may contain additional occurrences of the correct answer , which boosts the system s confidence in the answer through the redundancy measure .2 our passage-level combination algorithm adds to the passages extracted by the knowledge-based agent the top - ranked passages from the statistical agent that contain candidate answers of the right type .
if the two top answers are equivalent , the answer is selected with the combined confidence from both agents ; otherwise , the more confident answer is selected .5 in the second algorithm , the top 5 answers from each agent are allowed to participate in the voting process .
