two established trec qa evaluation metrics are adopted to assess the results for each run as follows : a confidence-weighted score that rewards systems with high confidence in correct answers as follows , where n is the number of questions : the top section shows the comparable baseline results from the statistical agent -LRB- sa-ss -RRB- and the single-source knowledge - based agent -LRB- kba-ss -RRB- .
if the two top answers are equivalent , the answer is selected with the combined confidence from both agents ; otherwise , the more confident answer is selected .5 in the second algorithm , the top 5 answers from each agent are allowed to participate in the voting process .
in our question answering system , piquant , we utilize in parallel multiple answering agents that adopt different processing strategies and consult different knowledge sources in identifying answers to given questions , and we employ resolution mechanisms to combine the results produced by the individual answering agents .
third , passages from agent 2 may contain additional occurrences of the correct answer , which boosts the system s confidence in the answer through the redundancy measure .2 our passage-level combination algorithm adds to the passages extracted by the knowledge-based agent the top - ranked passages from the statistical agent that contain candidate answers of the right type .
the -LRB- intermediate -RRB- results from the
