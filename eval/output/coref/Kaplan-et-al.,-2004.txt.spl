performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
the xle system achieves
the outside weight v -RRB- c of a conjunctive node is defined as the outside weight of its disjunctive mother node -LRB- s -RRB- : the outside weight of a disjunctive node is the sum of the product of the outside weight -LRB- s -RRB- of its conjunctive mother -LRB- s -RRB- , the weight -LRB- s -RRB- of its mother -LRB- s -RRB- , and the inside weight -LRB- s -RRB- of its disjunctive sister -LRB- s -RRB- : from these formulae , the conditional expectation of a feature-function fi can be computed from a chart with root node r for a sentence y in the following way : formula 5 is used in our system to compute expectations for discriminative bayesian estimation from partially labeled data using a first-order conjugate-gradient routine .
clearly , both versions of the xle system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the collins parser -LRB- 12 % for the core xle system and 20 % for the complete system -RRB- at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core xle system .
