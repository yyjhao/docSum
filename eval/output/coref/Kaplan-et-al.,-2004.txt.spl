performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
while it is relatively straightforward to convert lfg f-structures to the dependency bank format because the f-structure is effectively a dependency format , it is more difficult
however , a certain amount of skill and intuition was required to provide a fair conversion of the collins trees : we did not want to penalize configurations in the collins trees that encoded alternative but equally legitimate representations of the same linguistic properties -LRB- e.g. whether auxiliaries are encoded as main verbs or aspect features -RRB- , but we also did not want to build into the conversion program transformations that compensate for information that collins can not provide without ap pealing to additional linguistic resources -LRB- such as identifying the subjects of infinitival complements -RRB- .
clearly , both versions of the xle system achieve a significant reduction in error rate over the collins parser -LRB- 12 % for the core xle system and 20 % for the complete system -RRB- at an increase in parsing time of a factor of only 1.49 for the core xle system .
