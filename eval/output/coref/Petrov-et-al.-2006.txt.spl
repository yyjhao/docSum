the grammars recover patterns like those discussed in klein and manning -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , heavily articulating complex and frequent categories
therefore , this initialization is the absolute minimum starting grammar that includes the evaluation nonterminals -LRB- and maintains separate grammar symbols for each of them -RRB- .5 it is a very compact grammar : 98 symbols , 6 236 unary rules , and 3840 binary rules .
we found that merging 50 % of the newly split symbols dramatically reduced the grammar size after each splitting round , so that after 6 sm cycles , the grammar was only 17 % of the size it would otherwise have been -LRB- 1043 vs. 6273 subcategories -RRB- , while at the same time there was no loss in accuracy -LRB- figure 3 -RRB- .
inspecting a large grammar by hand is difficult , but fortunately , our baseline grammar has less than 100 nonterminal symbols , and even our most complicated grammar has only 1043 total -LRB- sub -RRB- symbols .
a particularly clean example of a split correlating external with internal contexts is the inverted sentence category -LRB- sinv -RRB- , which has only two subsymbols , one which usually has the root symbol as its parent -LRB- and which has sentence final puncutation as its last child -RRB- , and a second subsymbol which occurs in embedded contexts -LRB- and does not end in punctuation -RRB- .
