we assume we begin with some initial -LRB- possibly empty -RRB- taxonomy t. we restrict our consideration of possible new taxonomies to those created by the single operation add-relation -LRB- rij , t -RRB- , which adds the single relation rij to t. here k is the inverse odds of the prior on the event rij e t ; we consider this to be a constant independent of i , j , and the taxonomy t. to enforce the taxonomic constraints in t , for each application of the add-relation operator we must add all new relations in the implied set i -LRB- rij -RRB- not already in t. 5 thus we define the multiplicative change of the full set of implied relations as the product over all new relations : this definition leads to the following best-first search algorithm for hyponym acquisition , which at each iteration defines the new taxonomy as the union of the previous taxonomy t and the set of novel relations implied by the relation rzj that maximizes at -LRB- i -LRB- rzj -RRB- -RRB- and thus maximizes the conditional probability of the evidence over all possible single relations : extending the model to manage lexical ambiguity .
next , we iterate through each of the possible hypernym synsets l under which we might add the new word i ; for each synset l
