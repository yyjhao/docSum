previous work on determining the semantic orientation of adjectives has used a complex algorithm that does not readily extend beyond isolated adjectives to adverbs or longer phrases -LRB- hatzivassiloglou and mckeown , 1997 -RRB- .
the third step is to calculate the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the given review and classify the review as recommended if the average is positive and otherwise not recommended .
in addition to determining the direction of the phrase '' s semantic orientation -LRB- positive or negative , based on the sign of the rating -RRB- , this numerical rating also indicates the strength of the semantic orientation
although they do not consider the task of classifying reviews , it seems their algorithm could be plugged into the classification algorithm presented in section 2 , where it would replace pmi-ir and equation -LRB- 3 -RRB- in the second step .
the algorithm has three steps : -LRB- 1 -RRB- extract phrases containing adjectives or adverbs , -LRB- 2 -RRB- estimate the semantic orientation of each phrase , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- classify the review based on the average semantic orientation of the phrases .
a positive review could be summarized by picking out the sentence with the highest positive semantic orientation and a negative review could be summarized by extracting the sentence with the lowest negative semantic orientation .
