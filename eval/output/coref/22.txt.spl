some particular social networks on the web have been investigated in detail : l. adamic has classified the social network at stanford and mit students , and has collected relations among students from web link structure and text information -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
several indices can measure the co-occurrence -LSB- 29 -RSB- : matching coefficient , nxny ; mutual information , log -LRB- nnxny \/ nxny -RRB- ; dice coefficient , -LRB- 2nxny -RRB- \/ -LRB- nx + ny -RRB- ; jaccard coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ nxvy -RRB- ; overlap coefficient , -LRB- nxny \/ min -LRB- nx , ny -RRB- -RRB- ; and cosine , -LRB- nxny \/ v \/ nxny -RRB- ; where nx and ny denote the respective hit counts of name x and y , and nxny and nxvy denote the respective hit counts of x
the number of queries to a search engine becomes a problem when we apply extraction of a social network to a large-scale community : a network with 1000 nodes requires 500,000 queries and grows with o -LRB- n2 -RRB- , where n is the number of persons .
various types of retrieval are possible on the social network : researchers can be sought by name , affiliation , keyword , and research field ; related researchers to a retrieved researcher are listed ; and a search for the shortest path between two researchers can be made .
following that concept , we propose a new architecture to extract a social network from the web , called super social network mining .
