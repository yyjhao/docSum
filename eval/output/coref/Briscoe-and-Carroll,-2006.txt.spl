the full system can be extended in a variety of ways for example , by pruning pos tags but allowing multiple
table 1 shows accuracy results for each individual relation and feature , starting with the gr bilexical relations in the extended depbank and followed by most depbank features reported by kaplan et al. , and finally overall macro - and mi 4.3 evaluation issues the depbank num feature on nouns is evaluated by kaplan et al. on the grounds that it is semantically-relevant for applications .
king et al. do report individual results for selected features and relations from an evaluation of the complete xle parser on all 700 depbank sentences with an almost identical overall microaveraged f1 score of 79.5 % , suggesting that these results provide a reasonably accurate idea of the xle parsers relative performance on different features and relations .
we speculate that we achieve these results because our system is engineered to make minimal use of lexical information both in the grammar and in parse ranking , because the grammar has been developed to constrain ambiguity despite this lack of lexical information , and because we can compute the full packed parse forest for all the test sentences efficiently -LRB- without sacrificing speed of processing with respect to other statistical parsers -RRB- .
