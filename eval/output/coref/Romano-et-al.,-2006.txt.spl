more relevant for re are atomic paraphrases between templates , text fragments containing variables , e.g. x buy y q x purchase y. under a syntactic representation , a template is a parsed text fragment , e.g. x s + interact md ^ with ~ n y -LRB- based on the syntactic dependency relations of the minipar parser -RRB- .
candidate pairs that do not consist of two proteins , as tagged in the input dataset , were filtered out -LRB- see section 4.1 ; recall that our experiments were applied to the dataset of protein interactions , which isolates the re task from the protein name recognition task -RRB- .
to handle transparent head nouns , which is the only phenomenon that demonstrates domain dependence , we extracted a set of the 5 most frequent transparent head patterns in the development set , e.g. fragment of x. in order to compare -LRB- roughly -RRB- our performance with supervised methods applied to this dataset , as summarized in -LRB- bunescu et al. , 2005 -RRB- , we adopted
the 1st line shows the coverage of the 119 templates learned by tease for the input template x interact with y. it is interesting to note that , though we aim to learn relevant templates for the specific domain , tease learned relevant templates also by finding anchor-sets of different domains that use the same jargon , such as particle physics .
