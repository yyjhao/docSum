after extraction has been performed over the entire corpus , textrunner automatically merges tuples where both entities and normalized relation are identical and counts the number of distinct sentences from which each extraction was found .
every machine then computes an inverted index over the text of the locally-stored tuples , ensuring that each machine is guaranteed to store all of the tuples containing a reference to any relation assigned to that machine .4 the efficient indexing of tuples in textrunner means that when a user -LRB- or application -RRB- wants to access a subset
even though they were run over the same 9 million page corpus , textrunner s distributed extraction process took a total of 85 cpu hours , to perform extraction for all relations in the corpus at once , whereas knowitall , which analyzed all sentences in the corpus that potentially matched its rules , took an average of 6.3 hours per relation .
specifically , the tuples we evaluated met the following criteria : 1 -RRB- textrunner assigned a probability of at least 0.8 to the tuple ; 2 -RRB- the tuple s relation is supported by at least 10 distinct sentences in the corpus ; 3 -RRB- the tuple s relation is not found to be in the top 0.1 % of relations by number of supporting sentences .
