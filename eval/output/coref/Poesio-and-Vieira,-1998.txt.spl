we trained a version of the system on the corpus used for the first experiment , and then compared its classification of the corpus used for the second experiment with that of our three subjects .19 we developed two versions of the system : one which only attempts to classify subsequent
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
we also replaced the anaphoric -LRB- same head -RRB- class we had in the first experiment with a broader co-referent class including all cases in which a definite description is co-referential with its antecedent , whether or not the head noun was the same : e.g. , we asked the subjects to classify as co-referent a definite like the house referring back to an antecedent introduced as a victorian home , which would not have counted as anaphoric -LRB- same head -RRB- in our first experiment .
