for a potential customer , although he \/ she can read all reviews of different products at merchant sites
given a set of products -LRB- which may be from the same brand or different brands -RRB- and a set of urls of web pages that contain customer reviews , opinion observer works in two stages : stage 1 : extracting and analyzing customer reviews in two steps : step 1 : this step automatically connects to and downloads all customer reviews from the given pages .
our task : in order to visually compare consumer opinions on a set of products , we need to analyze the reviews in ri of each product pi -LRB- 1 -RRB- to find all the explicit and implicit product features on which reviewers have expressed their -LRB- positive or negative -RRB- opinions , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- to produce the positive opinion set and the negative opinion set for each feature .
from the list of features , we note the following : explicit features and implicit features : some features are genuine features , i.e. , &lt; photo &gt; , &lt; use &gt; , &lt; manual &gt; , &lt; option &gt; , &lt; video &gt; , &lt; battery &gt; , and &lt; software &gt; .
consequently , there are some patterns contain specific words for pros , e.g. , excellent &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- , great &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- , but for cons , there is no such pattern but only those patterns consisting of pos tags , e.g. , &lt; jj &gt; &lt; nn &gt; -LSB- feature -RSB- .
