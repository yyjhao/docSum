this assumption of similar meaning when multiple phrases map onto a single foreign language phrase is the converse of the assumption made in the word sense disambiguation work of diab and resnik -LRB- 2002 -RRB- which posits different word senses when a single english word maps onto different words in the foreign language -LRB- we return to this point in section 4.4 -RRB- .
much previous work on extracting paraphrases -LRB- barzilay and mckeown , 2001 ; barzilay and lee , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2003 -RRB- has focused on finding
we include a simple language model probability , which would additionally rank e2 based on the probability of the sentence formed by substiuting e2 for e1 in s. a possible extension which we do not evaluate might be permitting only paraphrases that are the same syntactic type as the original phrase , which we could do by extending the translation model probabilities to count only phrase occurrences of that type .
we evaluated the accuracy of top ranked paraphrases when the paraphrase probability was calculated using the manual alignments , the automatic alignments , automatic alignments produced over multiple corpora in different languages , all of the above with language model re-ranking , all of the above with the candidate paraphrases limited to the same sense as the original phrase .
