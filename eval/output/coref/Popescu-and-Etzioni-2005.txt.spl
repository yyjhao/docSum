relaxation labeling is an unsupervised classification technique which takes as input : a set of objects -LRB- e.g. , words -RRB- , a set of labels -LRB- e.g. , so labels -RRB- , initial probabilities for each objects possible labels , the definition of an object os neighborhood -LRB- a set of other objects which influence the choice of os label -RRB- , the definition of neighborhood features , the definition of a supportfunction for an object label .
this subtask is motivated by the existence of frequent words which change their so label based on associated features , but
in this section we evaluate opines performance on the following tasks : finding so labels of words in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- so label extraction -RRB- ; distinguishing between opinion and non-opinion phrases in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- opinion phrase extraction -RRB- ; finding the correct polarity of extracted opinion phrases in the context of known features and sentences -LRB- opinion phrase polarity extraction -RRB- .
in order to quantify the benefits of each of the three steps of our method for finding so labels , we also compared opine with a version which only finds so labels for words and a version which finds so labels for words in the context of given features , but doesnt take into account given sentences .
