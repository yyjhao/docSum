the subscripted noun phrases in the sample output constitute two noun phrase coreference equivalence classes : class js contains the five noun phrases that refer to john simon , and class pc contains the two noun phrases that represent prime corp. the figure also visually links neighboring coreferent noun phrases .
given a description of each noun phrase and a method for measuring the distance between two noun phrases , a clustering algorithm can then group noun phrases together : noun phrases with distance greater than a clustering radius r are not placed into the same partition and so are not considered coreferent .
here we use a simple , overly restrictive heuristic to determine whether or not the noun phrase is in a -LRB- post-posed -RRB- appositive construction : if the noun phrase is
in contrast to other approaches to coreference resolution , ours is unsupervised and offers several potential advantages over existing methods : no annotated training data is required , the distance metric can be easily extended to account for additional linguistic information as it becomes available to the nlp system , and the clustering approach provides a flexible mechanism for combining a variety of constraints and preferences to impose a partitioning on the noun phrases in a text into coreference equivalence classes .
