applying jensens inequality to the first term in eq -LRB- 9 -RRB- and the variational dual to the second term , we obtain that the change of log-likelihood in moving from model parameters ot-1 at time t 1 to ot at time t -LRB- which we shall denote qt -RRB- is bounded by al &gt; qt , where qt is defined by eq -LRB- 10 -RRB- , where h = -RSB- e -LCB- z i x ; o -RCB- when z = 1 and 1 -RSB- e -LCB- z i x ; o -RCB- when z = 0 , with expectations taken with respect to the parameters from the previous iteration .
mixw : this model is also obtained by training a maximum entropy model on the union of the out-of-domain and in-domain data sets , but where the out-of-domain data is down - weighted so that is effectively equinumerous with the in-domain data .
the prior model and the feats model perform roughly comparably , with the prior model edging out by a small margin .2 our model outperforms both the prior model and the feats model .
for the mention type task , the difference is statistical significant at the p &lt; 0.03 level ; for the mention tagging task , p &lt; 0.001 ; for the recapitalization tasks , the difference on the abc data is significant only at the p &lt; 0.06 level , while for the cnn \/ npr data it is significant at
