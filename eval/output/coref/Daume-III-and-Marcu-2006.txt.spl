we apply our model to four data sets with varying degrees of divergence between the in-domain and out-of-domain data and obtain predictive accuracies higher than any of a large number of baseline systems and a second model proposed in the literature for this problem .
in the case of the maximum entropy models we consider here , the weights learned from the out-of-domain data are used as the
mixw : this model is also obtained by training a maximum entropy model on the union of the out-of-domain and in-domain data sets , but where the out-of-domain data is down - weighted so that is effectively equinumerous with the in-domain data .
as the out-of-domain data , we use the newswire and broadcast news portions of the ace 2005 training data ; as the in-domain data , we use the fisher conversations data .
the prior model and the feats model perform roughly comparably , with the prior model edging out by a small margin .2 our model outperforms both the prior model and the feats model .
our model can be seen as a constrained experts model , with three experts , where the constraints specify that in-domain data can only come from one of two experts , and out-of-domain data can only come from one of two experts -LRB- with a single expert overlapping between the two -RRB- .
