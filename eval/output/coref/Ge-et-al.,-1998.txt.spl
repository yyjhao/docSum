in particular , the scheme infers the gender of a referent from the gender of the pronouns that refer to it and selects referents using the pronoun anaphora program .
given a particular choice of the antecedent candidates , the distance is independent of distances of candidates other than the antecedent -LRB- and the distance to non-referents can be ignored -RRB- : the syntactic structure so and the distance from the pronoun da are independent of the number of
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
the impact of this probability can be seen more clearly from another experiment in which we tested the program -LRB- using just hobbs distance and gender information -RRB- on the training data .
by collating by referent and abstracting away to the gender classes of pronouns , rather than individual pronouns , we have the relative frequencies with which a given referent is referred to by pronouns of each gender class .
