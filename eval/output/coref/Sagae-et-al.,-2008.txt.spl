while parsing research has undoubtedly benefited from comparisons of parsers on a standard test set using the same evaluation criteria -LRB- precision and recall of labeled brackets for phrase structures , and accuracy for dependencies -RRB- , this practice has in some ways diverted attention from other parsing approaches , which have also progressed significantly -LRB- clark and curran , 2004 ; miyao and tsujii , 2005 ; briscoe et al. , 2006 -RRB- , and are capable of identifying deep syntactic information -LRB- such as long-distance dependencies -RRB- that are ignored by parsers based on the shallow representations derived from the penn treebank -LRB- ptb -RRB- .
for example , the parc 700 dependencybank -LRB- king et al. , 2003 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of lfg parsers -LRB- kaplan et al. , 2004 ; burke et al. , 2004 -RRB- , a ccg tree - bank
conversion to shallow ptb trees was done by mapping tree patterns from enju 's phrase structure output into the corresponding shallow ptb tree patterns , and conversion to sd was done by first converting enju 's output to shallow ptb format , then applying the same ptb-to-sd utility used with the ptb parsers .
in addition , unlike in the hpsg - &gt; gr conversion , which was developed based on gold-standard sets , the sd - &gt; gr conversion was developed using the 700-sentence gr gold-standard , and the same sentences with sd annotations obtained from automatic conversion from gold-standard ptb trees .
