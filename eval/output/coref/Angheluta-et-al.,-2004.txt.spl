then the chains are iteratively merged when their fuzzy set intersection is no larger than an a priori defined distance , in other words when there is at least one noun phrase in the fuzzy set of both clusters that has a distance smaller than a threshold with the respective medoids of the clusters .
beside the fuzzy representation , there are two main differences with -LSB- 3 -RSB- : 1 -RRB- the chaining effect is larger because two clusters can be merged even without checking any pairwise incompatibilities of cluster objects ; 2 -RRB- in contrast with -LSB- 3 -RSB- , the algorithm is independent of the order in which the clusters are merged .
it seemed to us that the previous algorithms exhibit some good points and that a fuzzy clustering is appropriate for the noun phrase coreference task , but the fuzziness could be exploited in such a way that - in contrast with -LSB- 2 -RSB- - uncertainty of cluster membership of all fuzzy members plays a role in cluster merging .
merging
the algorithm favors big clusters , which is confirmed by the results of our second baseline , which clusters all entities in one cluster -LRB- see below -RRB- -LRB- vilain f-measure is 86 % for the dryrun set , 87 % for the formaltest set and 60 % for the duc subcorpus -RRB- .
