the analysis in the previous section suggests a baseline method for classifying links between adjectives : since 77.84 % of all links from conjunctions indicate same orientation , we can achieve this level of performance by always guessing that a link is of the same - orientation type .
each pair of adjectives has an associated dissimilarity value between 0
we separated our sets of adjectives a -LRB- containing 1,336 adjectives -RRB- and conjunction - and morphology - based links l -LRB- containing 2,838 links -RRB- into training and testing groups by selecting , for several values of the parameter a , the maximal subset of a , a , , which includes an adjective x if and only if there exist at least a links from l between x and other elements of a , .
as we noted earlier , the corpus data is eventually represented in our system as a graph , with the nodes corresponding to adjectives and the links to predictions about whether the two connected adjectives have the same or different orientation .
for p = 0.8 , we need only about 7 links per adjective for classification performance over 90 % and only 12 links per adjective for performance over 99 % .6 the difference between low and high values of p is in the rate at which increasing data increases overall precision .
