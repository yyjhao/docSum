if the appreciation of a human observer of an object is based on the perception of certain conspicuous items in the image -LSB- 177 -RSB- , it is natural to direct the computation of broad domain features to
an image expressed as -LRB- r -LRB- x -RRB- , g -LRB- x -RRB- , b -LRB- x -RRB- -RRB- -LRB- indices will be omitted from now on -RRB- makes most sense when recording in the absence of variance , as is the case , e.g. , for art paintings -LSB- 64 -RSB- , the color composition of photographs -LSB- 48 -RSB- , and trademarks -LSB- 79 -RSB- , -LSB- 39 -RSB- , where two-dimensional images are recorded in frontal view under standard conditions .
the lowest levels of the wavelet transforms -LSB- 34 -RSB- , -LSB- 26 -RSB- have been applied to texture representation -LSB- 92 -RSB- , -LSB- 162 -RSB- sometimes in conjunction with markovian analysis -LSB- 25 -RSB- .
other systems based on signs are designed with specific application domains in mind , like ocr from an image -LSB- 200 -RSB- , faces to detect from the image -LSB- 197 -RSB- , medical images -LSB- 90 -RSB- , -LSB- 17 -RSB- , textile -LSB- 95 -RSB- , art -LSB- 65 -RSB- , or detecting the constituent components of silhouettes of plants based on a visual lexicon in -LSB- 180 -RSB- .
it is regrettable that not too much work across the division between the disciplines of vision and databases has been done yet , with a few exceptions in commercial systems -LSB- 48 -RSB- , -LSB- 61 -RSB- and research -LSB- 46 -RSB- , -LSB- 85 -RSB- , -LSB- 171 -RSB- .
