our corpus was compiled from three data sources that have been previously used for paraphrase induction -LRB- barzilay and mckeown 2001 ; pang , knight , and marcu 2003 ; dolan , quirk , and brockett 2004 -RRB- : the multiple-translation chinese -LRB- mtc -RRB- corpus , jules vernes twenty thousand leagues under the sea novel -LRB- leagues -RRB- , and the microsoft research -LRB- msr -RRB- paraphrase corpus .
the quality of an alignment a -LRB- defined in equation -LRB- 1 -RRB- -RRB- compared to reference alignment b can be then computed using standard recall , precision , and f1 measures -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : to give an example , consider the sentence pairs in figure 2 , whose alignments have been produced by the two annotators a -LRB- left -RRB- and b -LRB- right -RRB- .
these include phrase pairs whose words are aligned to each other or nothing , but not to words outside the phrase boundaries .10 the phrase extraction heuristic creates masses of phrase pairs , many of which are of dubious quality .
our annotators -LRB- two linguistics graduates -RRB- were given pairs of sentences and asked to show which parts of these were in correspondence by aligning them on a word-byword basis .7 our definition of alignment was fairly general -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : given a source string x = x1 , ... , xn and a target string y = y1 , ... , ym , an alignment a between two
