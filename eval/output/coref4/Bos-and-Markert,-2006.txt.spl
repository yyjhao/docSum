we will introduce the shallow semantic analysis -LRB- section 2 -RRB- and the deep semantic analysis -LRB- section 3 -RRB- , present the results of our two runs
in addition , we use four other shallow features : textlength measuring the length of t in words , hyplength measuring the length of the hypothesis and proplength measuring the difference between textlength and h len th as textlength the last shallow feature task simply uses the task variable -LRB- one of sum , qa , ie , ir -RRB- as our results in rte-1 -LRB- bos and markert , 2005 -RRB- showed that the different tasks can need different inference methods .
we perform model building using two different model builders : we use paradox to find the size of the domain , and then use mace to construct a minimal model giving that domain size .
put differently , the domain size for t + h would equal the domain size of t. in contrast , if t does not entail h , h normally introduce some new information -LRB- except when it contains negated information -RRB- , and this will be reflected in the domain size of t + h , which then is larger than the domain size of t. it turns out that this difference between the domain sizes is a useful way of measuring the likelihood of entailment .
