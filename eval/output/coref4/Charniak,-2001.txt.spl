the named entity recognition program used to create the input looks at only a few features of the context in which the name appears , the complete name , and the individual words that appear in the name irrespective of the other words .
we assume that peoples names have six -LRB- optional -RRB- components as exemplified in the following somewhat contrived example : our models make the following assumptions about personal names : all words of label l -LRB- the label number -RRB- must occur before all words of label l + 1 , with the exception of descriptors , a maximum of one word may appear for each label , every name must include either a first name or a last name , in a loose sense , honorifics and closes are closed classes , even if we do not know which words are in the classes .
to establish a more detailed relationship between the old and new names we compute possible correspondences between the two names , where a correspondence specifies for each word in the old name if it is retained in the new name , and if so , the word in the new name to which it corresponds .
to evaluate the coreference model we looked at the possible coreference data to find if
