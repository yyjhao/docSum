our aim is to find a method which allow us to automatically create and maintain entity gazetteers by extracting the necessary information from linguistic resources .
our motivation is that proper nouns that form entities can be obtained from the entries in an encyclopedia and that some features of their definitions in the encyclopedia can help to classify them into their correct entity category .
from this noun hierarchy we consider the nodes -LRB- called synsets in wordnet -RRB- which in our opinion represent more accurately the different kind of entities we are working with -LRB- location , organization and person -RRB- .
finally , we apply a weighting algorithm which takes into account the amount of nouns in the definition identified as belonging to the different entity types considered and decides to which entity type the entry belongs .
once we have this basic approach we apply different heuristics which we think may improve the results obtained and which effect will be analyzed in the section about results .
another important fact is that the method has a high degree of
therefore , we think that our method can be useful for the creation of gazetteers for languages in which ner gazetteers are not available but have wikipedia and wordnet resources .
