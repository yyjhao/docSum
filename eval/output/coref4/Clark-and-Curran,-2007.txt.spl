parsers have been developed for a variety of grammar formalisms , for example hpsg -LRB- toutanova et al. , 2002 ; malouf and van noord , 2004 -RRB- , lfg -LRB- kaplan et al. , 2004 ; cahill et al. , 2004 -RRB- , tag -LRB- sarkar and joshi , 2003 -RRB- , ccg -LRB- hockenmaier and steed - man , 2002 ; clark and curran , 2004b -RRB- , and variants of phrase-structure grammar -LRB- briscoe et al. , 2006 -RRB- , including the phrase-structure grammar implicit in the penn treebank -LRB- collins , 2003 ; charniak , 2000 -RRB- .
and third , we provide the first evaluation of a wide - coverage ccg parser outside of ccgbank , obtaining impressive results on depbank and outperforming the rasp parser -LRB- briscoe et al. , 2006 -RRB- by over 5 % overall and on the majority of dependency types .
kaplan et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- compare the collins -LRB- 2003 -RRB- parser with the parc lfg parser by mapping lfg
we chose this resource for the following reasons : it is publicly available , allowing other researchers to compare against our results ; the grs making up the annotation share some similarities with the predicate - argument dependencies output by the ccg parser ; and we can directly compare our parser against a non-ccg parser , namely the rasp parser .
the overall f-score for the ccg parser , 81.86 % , is only 3 points below that for ccgbank , which provides an upper bound for the ccg parser -LRB- given the conversion process being used -RRB- .
