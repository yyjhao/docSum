however , prior work on semantic relatedness was based on purely statistical techniques that did not make use of background knowledge -LSB- baeza-yates and ribeiro-neto , 1999 ; deerwester et al. , 1990 -RSB- , or on lexical resources that incorporate very limited knowledge about the world -LSB- budanitsky and hirst , 2006 ; jarmasz , 2003 -RSB- .
we use machine learning techniques to build a semantic interpreter that maps fragments of natural language text into a weighted sequence of wikipedia concepts ordered by their relevance to the input .
entries of this vector reflect the relevance of the corresponding concepts to text t. to compute semantic relatedness of a pair of text fragments we compare their vectors using the cosine metric .
we processed the text of these articles by removing stop words and rare words , and stemming the remaining words ; this yielded 389,202 distinct terms , which served for representing wikipedia concepts as attribute vectors .
the ability to quantify semantic relatedness of texts underlies many fundamental tasks in computational linguistics , including word sense disambiguation , information retrieval , word and text clustering , and error correction -LSB- budanitsky and hirst , 2006 -RSB- .
finally , even for
on the other hand , our approach represents each word as a weighted vector of wikipedia concepts , and semantic relatedness is then computed by comparing the two concept vectors .
