we have implemented a logic prover , called cogex -LRB- from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate -RRB- which uniformly codifies the question and answer text , as well as world knowledge resources , in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers .
in addition to the logic representations of questions and candidate answers , the qa logic prover needs world knowledge axioms to link question concepts to answer concepts .
the challenges one faces when using automated reasoning in the context of nlp include : logic representation of open text , need of world knowledge axioms , logic representation of semantically equivalent linguistic patterns , and others .
the qa system includes traditional modules such as question processing , document retrieval , answer extraction , built in ontologies , as well as many tools such as syntactic parser , name entity recognizer , word sense disambiguation -LRB- moldovan and noviscki 2002 -RRB- , logic representation of text -LRB- moldovan and rus 2001 -RRB- and others .
lexical chains improve the performance of question answering systems in two ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- increase the document retrieval recall and -LRB- 2 -RRB- improve the answer extraction by providing the much needed world knowledge axioms that link question keywords with answers concepts .
