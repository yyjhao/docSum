the structural paraphrases produced by our algorithm are similar to the s-rules advocated by katz and levin for question answering -LRB- 1988 -RRB- , except that our paraphrases are automatically generated .
based on aligned monolingual corpora , our technique for extracting paraphrases builds on lin and pantels insight of using dependency paths -LRB- derived from parsing -RRB- as the fundamental unit of learning and using parts of those paths as features .
using the approach described in previous sections , we were able to extract nearly six thousand different paraphrases -LRB- see table 1 -RRB- from our corpus , which consisted of two translations of 20,000 leagues under the sea , two translations of the kreutzer sonata , and three translations of madame bouvary .
similar to the work of barzilay and lee -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , who have applied paraphrase generation techniques to comparable corpora consisting of different newspaper articles about the same event , we are currently attempting to solve the data sparseness problem by extending our approach to non-parallel corpora .
6 paraphrases and question answering the ultimate goal of our work on paraphrases is to enable the development of high-precision question answering system -LRB- cf .
the problems associated with keyword query expansion techniques stem from the fundamental deficiencies of bag-of-words approaches ; in short , they simply can not accurately model the semantic
