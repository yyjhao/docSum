axioms in our system are utilized to provide external world knowledge , knowledge of syntactic equivalence between logic form predicates , and lexical knowledge in the form of lexical chains .
the system generates the following axiom for this relation : these axioms help the logic prover infer target concepts from starting concepts when lexical chains are found between the two .
once a proof by refutation is found , a score for that proof is calculated by starting with an initial perfect score and deducting points for axioms that are utilized in the proof , arguments that are relaxed , and predicates that are dropped .
the score generated by the logic prover is only a measure of the kinds of axioms used in the proof and the significance of the dropped arguments and predicates .
all normalized prover scores that fall below a specified threshold are considered false entailment and all scores that are above the
this inferencing inability causes the logic prover to drop a large number of predicates and return extremely low scores for the false entailment pairs .
before evaluating the t-h pairs in the test set with our system , we manually determined how difficult it is to prove entailment in each of the true entailment t-h pairs .
