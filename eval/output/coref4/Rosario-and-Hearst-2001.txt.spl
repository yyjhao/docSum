note that because we are concerned with the semantic relations that hold between the concepts , as opposed to the more standard , syntax-driven computational goal of determining left versus right association , this has the fortuitous effect of changing the problem into one of classification , amenable to standard machine learning classification techniques .
it turns out that the test set for relationship 7 -LRB- produces on a genetic level -RRB- is dominated by ncs containing the words alleles and mrna and that all the ncs in the training set containing these
other words in the test set for 14 are varicella which is present in the trainig set only in varicella serology labeled as attribute of clinical study , drainage which is in the training set only as location -LRB- gallbladder drainage and tract drainage -RRB- and activity -LRB- bile drainage -RRB- .
it is interesting to note that the accuracy for case 1 -LRB- first noun not present in the training set -RRB- is much higher than the accuracy for case 2 -LRB- second noun not present in the training set -RRB- .
these results can be compared with vanderwende note that for unseen words , the baseline lexical-based logistic regression approach , which essentially builds a tabular representation of the log-odds for each class , also reduces to random guessing .
