we are interested in models that can perform three tasks : modeling the joint distribution of an image and its caption , modeling the conditional distribution of words given an image , and modeling the conditional distribution of words given a particular region of an image .
given a corpus of image \/ caption data , d = -LCB- -LRB- rd , wd -RRB- -RCB- dd = 1 , we find maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters with a variational em procedure that maximizes the lower bound on the log likelihood of the data induced by the variational approximation described above .
the independence assumptions of the corr-lda model are a compromise between the extreme correspondence enforced by the gm-mixture model , where the entire image and caption are conditional on the same factor , and the lack of correspondence in the gm-lda model , where the image regions and caption words can conceivably be conditional on two disparate sets of factors .
to evaluate how well a model fits the data , we computed the per-image average negative log likelihood
in this paper , we build a set of increasingly sophisticated models for a database of annotated images , culminating in correspondence latent dirichlet allocation -LRB- corr-lda -RRB- , a model that finds conditional relationships between latent variable representations of sets of image regions and sets of words .
