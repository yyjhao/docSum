for example , assume that the correct grouping result for
the idea of the grouping algorithm is that if we are highly confident about grouping two citations ci and c ; together in a set s1 , and we are highly confident about grouping two citations c ; and ck together in a set s2 , and s1 and s2 share one or more citations -LRB- c ; in our example -RRB- , then we are confident about grouping s1 and s2 together in one group s3 .
section 3 introduces our multi-faceted approach to solving the problem by explaining the three facets we use -LRB- attributes , links , and page similarity -RRB- , showing how to construct a confidence matrix for each facet and how to combine all the confidence matrices into a final confidence matrix , and giving the algorithm we use to group returned citations .
for example , we estimate p -LRB- same person = yes i share2 = yes -RRB- , which is the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the web pages referenced by them share exactly two adjacent cap-word pairs in our training set , by dividing the number of citation pairs that are related to the same person and share two cap-word pairs by the number of citation pairs that share two cap-word pairs .
