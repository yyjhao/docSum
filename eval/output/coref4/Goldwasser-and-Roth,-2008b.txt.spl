the sample selection process is guided by the sufficient spanning features criterion -LRB- ssf -RRB- introduced in section 2.2 , to identify informative samples in the source language.an oracle capable of pairing a ne in the source language with
the remainder of this section provides details about these stages ; the basic formulation of the transliteration model and the feature extraction scheme is described in section 2.1 , in section 2.2 the selective sampling process is described and finally section 2.3 explains how learning is focused by using feature weights .
our transliteration model takes a discriminative approach ; the classifier is presented with a word pair -LRB- ws , wt -RRB- , where ws is a named entity and it is asked to determine whether wt is a transliteration of the ne in the target language .
in this paper we presented a new approach for constructing a transliteration model automatically and efficiently by selectively extracting transliteration samples covering relevant parts of the feature space and focusing the learning process on these features .
another aspect investigated is using our selective sampling for adapting the learning process for data originating from different sources using the a reference set representative of the testing data , training samples , originating from a different source , can be biased towards the testing data .
