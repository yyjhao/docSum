since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
a summary of phrase-level and sentence-level meronymic
for each set of unambiguous positive and negative examples at each level in the downward descent , we apply quinlan-s c4 .5 algorithm and learn classification rules of the form if x is \/ is not of a wordnet semantic class a and y is \/ is not of wordnet semantic class b , then the instance is \/ is not a part-whole relation .
thus , for the genitive cluster we used a training corpus of 27,961 positive examples -LRB- 325 pairs of concepts in a part-whole relation extracted from corpus - a - and 27,636 extracted from wordnet as selected pairs -RRB- and 18,611 negative examples -LRB- the non-part-whole relations extracted from corpus - a - -RRB- .
the set of rules represents the rules to be used for classifying the new instances and the default value represents the target value -LRB- yes if an instance is a part-whole relation and no if the instance is not a part-whole relation -RRB- that should be returned if none of the rules classify the new instances .
