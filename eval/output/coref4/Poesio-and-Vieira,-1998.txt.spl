a definite description may rely on specific knowledge about the larger situation : this is the case in which both the speaker and the hearer know about the existence of the referent , as in the example below , in which it is assumed that speaker and hearer are both inhabitants of halifax , a town which has
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
we trained a version of the system on the corpus used for the first experiment , and then compared its classification of the corpus used for the second experiment with that of our three subjects .19 we developed two versions of the system : one which only attempts to classify subsequent mention and discourse-new definite descriptions -LRB- vieira and poesio , 1997 -RRB- , and one which also attempts to classify bridging references -LRB- poesio et al. , 1997 -RRB- .
