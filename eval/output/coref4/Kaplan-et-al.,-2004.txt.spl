performance parameters of both the collins parser and the xle system were adjusted on a heldout set consisting of a random selection of 1 \/ 5 of the parc 700 dependency bank ; experimental results were then based on the other 560 sentences .
while it is relatively straightforward to convert lfg f-structures to the dependency bank format because the f-structure is effectively a dependency format , it is more difficult to transform the output trees of the model 3 collins parser in
the xle system achieves 12 % reduction in error rate over the collins parser , that is 77.6 % f-score for the xle system versus 74.6 % for the collins parser , at a cost in parsing time of a factor of 1.49 .
however , a certain amount of skill and intuition was required to provide a fair conversion of the collins trees : we did not want to penalize configurations in the collins trees that encoded alternative but equally legitimate representations of the same linguistic properties -LRB- e.g. whether auxiliaries are encoded as main verbs or aspect features -RRB- , but we also did not want to build into the conversion program transformations that compensate for information that collins can not provide without ap pealing to additional linguistic resources -LRB- such as identifying the subjects of infinitival complements -RRB- .
