then any subsequent document that is placed into that cluster is a candidate for labeling as on-topic for that topic , and the tracking system 's confidence score for labeling on-topic can be equated to the detection system 's confidence score for placing the document in that cluster .
our scoring formula is cluster dependent because of the '' dynamic word-weight '' where idf0 -LRB- w -RRB- is the traditional okapi inverse document frequence , nw is the number of documents -LRB- so far -RRB- that contain word w , and ncl is the number of documents -LRB- so far -RRB- in cluster cl and nw , , l is the number of documents in the cluster which contain the word ; the a is an adjustable parameter .
by viewing the resulting system 's performance in terms of recall and number of false alarms per
this leads us to make two observations : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a topic detection system well - optimized to the tdt detection task converts into a naive tracking system that does not probe the area of interest to the tdt tracking task , and -LRB- 2 -RRB- in order to convert a detection system into a tracking system , it is necessary to record the scores of all documents with respect to the topical cluster , not merely those documents that are merged into it .
