the software packages used in our evaluation are the bikel parser -LSB- 15 -RSB- , the collins parser -LSB- 16 -RSB- , the stanford parser -LSB- 17,18 -RSB- and the charniak parser -LSB- 19 -RSB- including a modified version known herein as the charniak-lease parser -LSB- 20 -RSB- .
the reconstruction of co-ordinating conjunctions -LRB- e.g. ' and ' \/ ' or ' constructs -RRB- was slightly more difficult than average for each parser , and the correct attachment of negation words -LRB- e.g. ' not ' or ' without ' -RRB- proved problematic for the bikel parser , although the charniak-lease parser was more successful on this task .
the stanford algorithm provides a de facto standard for comparing a variety of constituent parsers and treebanks at the dependency level ; if the dependency parser community were to adopt the same set of grammatical relations as standard , then native dependency parsers could be compared to constituent parsers and to biological treebanks fairly and transparently .
the charniak and charniak-lease parsers perform pos-tagging internally , but the difference between them is that while the original charniak parser learns to pos-tag as part of the parsing engine 's training process and therefore is distributed with a general-english pos-tagging vocabulary learned from the penn treebank the charniak-lease parser has a decoupled pos-tagging module which can be trained separately , and is provided pre-trained on a different part of the genia corpus from that which is included in the genia treebank .
