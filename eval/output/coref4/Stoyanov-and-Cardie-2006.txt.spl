several research efforts -LRB- e.g. riloff and wiebe -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , bethard et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , wilson et al. -LRB- 2004 -RRB- , yu and hatzivassiloglou -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , wiebe and riloff -LRB- 2005 -RRB- -RRB- have shown that sentiment information can be extracted at the sentence , clause , or individual opinion expression level -LRB- fine-grained opinion information -RRB- .
nevertheless , as a first attempt at source coreference resolution , we employ a state-of-the - art machine learning approach to np coreference resolution developed by ng and cardie -LRB- 2002 -RRB- .
however , little has been done to develop methods for combining fine-grained opinion information to
second , due mainly to the time-consuming nature of coreference annotation , np coreference information is incomplete in our data set : np mentions that are not sources of opinion are not annotated with coreference information -LRB- even when they are part of a chain that contains source nps -RRB- 4 .
in the context of source coreference resolution we consider a noun phrase to correspond to -LRB- or match -RRB- a source if the source and the np cover the exact same span of text .
we determine the match in the problematic cases using a set of heuristics : if a source matches any np exactly in span , match that source to the np ; do this even if multiple nps overlap the source we are dealing with nested np s .
