we use two different lists of semantic target categories : the list of 35 semantic relations and the list of 8 prepositional paraphrases and compare our results with those obtained on the same test set by lauer -LRB- 1995 -RRB- and lapata and keller -LRB- 2004 -RRB- .
although researchers -LRB- jespersen , 1954 ; downing , 1977 -RRB- argued that noun compounds encode an infinite set of semantic relations , many agree -LRB- levi , 1978 ; finin , 1980 -RRB- there is a limited number of relations that occur with high frequency in noun compounds .
although noun compounds are very productive allowing for a fairly large number of possible interpretations , table 3 shows that
since we wanted to measure the impact of syntactic and semantic ambiguities of noun compounds on the interpretation performance , we further tested the probabilistic web-based model on four distinct test sets selected from the wall street journal text collection , each containing 200 nounnoun pairs encoding different types of ambiguity : in set # 1 the noun constituents had only one part of speech and one wordnet sense ; in set # 2 the nouns had at least two possible parts of speech and were semantically unambiguous , in set # 3 the nouns were ambiguous only semantically , and in set # 4 they were ambiguous both syntactically and semantically .
