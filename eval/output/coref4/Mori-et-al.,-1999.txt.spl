the key concept of the method is as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- each image is divided into many parts and at the same time all attached words for each image are inherited to each part ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- parts of all images are vector quantized to make clusters ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the likelihood for each word in each cluster is estimated statistically .
using a morpheme analysis program called ~ chasen '' -LRB- resulting in about 100,000 vocabularies -RRB- , select only -LRB- common and proper -RRB- nouns and adjectives -LRB- resulting in about 51,708 vocabularies -RRB- , eliminate rare words -LRB- those which less than frequency of 64 -RRB- , finally 1,585 words are remain -LRB- their frequencies range from 5,150 to 64 -RRB- after the extraction on average 32 words are attached to each image in average .
tables 1 and 2 show the examples of output words -LRB- the top 3 words -RRB- for images in the recognition group -LRB- i.e. ' unknown ' images -RRB- .
in
in table 1 and 2 , hit words appear more than in the case of random selection -LRB- if it is a random selection from a set of words with uniform frequencies , the probability is about 3 \/ 1585 -RRB- .
in this paper , we have proposed a new method for correlating images with key words based on two kinds of processes , that is , dividing images and vector quantization .
