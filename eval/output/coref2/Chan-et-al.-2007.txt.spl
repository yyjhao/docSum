to incorporate wsd into hiero , we use the translations
to achieve this , when a grammar rule r is considered during decoding , and we recognize that some of the terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in a are also chosen by the wsd system as translations for some terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in - y , we compute the following features : note that we can take the negative logarithm of the rule \/ derivation weights and think of them as costs rather than probabilities .
after wsd , the ith word ci in every chinese sentence may have up to 3 sets of associated translations provided by the wsd system : a set of translations for ci as a single word , a second set of translations for ci _ 1ci considered as a single unit , and a third set of translations for cici + 1 considered as a single unit .
second , the match must contain at least one aligned chinese - english word pair , but we do not make any other requirements about the alignment of the other chinese or english words .1 if there are multiple possible matches , we choose the longest proposed translation ; in the case of a tie , we choose the proposed translation with the highest score according to the wsd model .
