gazetteer \/ dictionary features features obtained by running other named-entity classifiers -LRB- with different tag sets -RRB- : hmm , maxent and rrm output
the following is a list of additional features -LRB- again , is the current token -RRB- : a capitalization \/ word-type flag -LRB- similar to the ones described by bikel et al. -LRB- 1997 -RRB- -RRB- ; gazetteer information : a handful of location -LRB- 55k entries -RRB- person names -LRB- 30k -RRB- and organizations -LRB- 5k -RRB- dictionaries ; a combination of gazetteer , pos and capitalization information , obtained as follows : if the word is a closed-class word select its class , else if its in a dictionary select that class , otherwise back-off to its capitalization information ; we call this feature gap ; wordnet information -LRB- the synsets and hypernyms of the two most frequent senses of the word -RRB- ; the outputs of three systems -LRB- hmm , rrm and maxent -RRB- trained on a 32-category named entity data , the output of an rrm system trained on the muc-6 data , and the output of rrm model identifying 49 categories .
in the comparative experiments for the mention detection and entity tracking tasks , the training data for the english system consists of the training data from both the 2002 evaluation and the 2003 evaluation , while for arabic and chinese , new additions to the ace task in 2003 , consists of 80 % of the provided training data .
