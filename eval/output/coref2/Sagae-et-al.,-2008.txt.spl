while parsing research has undoubtedly benefited from comparisons of parsers on a standard test set using the same evaluation criteria -LRB- precision and recall of labeled brackets for phrase structures , and accuracy for dependencies -RRB- , this practice has in some ways diverted attention from other parsing approaches , which have also progressed significantly -LRB- clark and curran , 2004 ; miyao and tsujii , 2005 ; briscoe et al. , 2006 -RRB- , and are capable of identifying deep syntactic information -LRB- such as long-distance dependencies -RRB- that are ignored by parsers based on the shallow representations derived from the penn treebank -LRB- ptb -RRB- .
for example , the parc 700 dependencybank -LRB- king et al. , 2003 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of lfg parsers -LRB- kaplan et al. , 2004 ; burke et al. , 2004 -RRB- , a ccg tree - bank -LRB- ccgbank -RRB- -LRB- hockenmaier and steedman , 2002 -RRB- was used for the evaluation of ccg parsing models -LRB- hockenmaier , 2003 ; clark and curran , 2004 -RRB- , and hpsg treebanks , which were created manually -LRB- oepen et al. , 2004 -RRB- or derived from ptb data -LRB- miyao et al. , 2005 -RRB- , were used for the evaluation of hpsg parsers -LRB- toutanova et al. , 2004 ; miyao and tsujii , 2005 ; ninomiya et al. , 2007 ; sagae et al. , 2007 -RRB- .
conversion to shallow ptb trees was done by mapping tree patterns from enju 's phrase structure output into the corresponding shallow ptb tree patterns , and conversion to
