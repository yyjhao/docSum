in section 4.1 we describe our evaluation methodology ; in sections 4.2 and 4.3 we analyze the fine-grained precision and disambiguation precision of our algorithm compared to the baseline ; in section 4.4 we compare the coarse-grained precision of our links -LRB- motivated by categories defined by the wordnet supersenses -RRB- against the baseline algorithm and against an oracle for named entity recognition .
next , we iterate through each of the possible hypernym synsets l under which we might add the new word i ; for each synset l we compute the change in taxonomy score resulting from adding the implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- required by the taxonomic constraints of t. since typically our set of all evidence involving i will be much smaller than the set of possible relations in i -LRB- h1 gl -RRB- , we may efficiently check whether , for each sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , for all words where we have some evidence ergw , whether s participates in some relation with i in the set of implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- .7 if there is more than one sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , we add to i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- the single relationship rgs that maximizes the taxonomy likelihood , i.e. argmaxs ^ senses -LRB- w -RRB- at -LRB- rgs -RRB- .
first , we identify the set of all the word pairs -LRB- i , j
