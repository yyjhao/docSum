we chose to use physical size for the following reasons : most entities -LRB- except abstract entities -RRB- have a physical size .
we applied support vector machine -LRB- svm -RRB- - based learning -LRB- vapnik , 1999 -RRB- using three types of features : -LRB- 1 -RRB- basic pattern features -LRB- section 3.1 -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- selected pattern features -LRB- section 3.2 -RRB- , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- physical size features -LRB- section 3.3 -RRB- .
we thus selected the most informative n patterns -LRB- step 1 -RRB- and conducted specific searches -LRB- # of samples x n basic patterns -RRB- -LRB- step2 -RRB- as follows : step1 : to select the most informative patterns , we applied a decision tree -LRB- c4 .5 -RRB- -LRB- quinlan , 1987 -RRB- and selected the basic patterns located in the top n branches 3 .
we estimated entity size using the following queries
when results of size expressions were insufficient -LRB- numbers &lt; 10 -RRB- , we considered the entity to be nonphysical , i.e. , to have no size .
however , contrary to our expectations , size features were disappointing for part - whole relations -LRB- rel6 -RRB- and content-container relations -LRB- rel7 -RRB- .
these sizes are unusually small for the following reasons : some entities -LRB- e.g. ' scar 's -RRB- rarely appear with their size , in contrast , entities such as ' stoy car 's or ' smini car 's frequently appear with a size .
we briefly presented a method for obtaining the size of an entity and proposed a method for classifying semantic relations using entity size .
