this compound disambiguation system -LRB- named pro , for proportional relation occurrence ; see costello , veale , &amp; dunne , 2006 -RRB- makes use of a corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with word - net senses and covering 139 different semantic relations , with each noun and each relation annotated with its correct wordnet sense .1 section 2 of the paper will describe the format and structure of this corpus , section 3 will describe the original pro compound disambiguation system , and section 4 will explain how the pro system was adapted to deduce the correct semantic relation between a pair of nominals , as in semeval task 4 .
the remaining compounds were placed in random order , and a research assistant annotated each with the wordnet noun senses of the constituent words , the semantic relation between those words , and the wordnet verb sense of that relation .
the system performs best using the most frequent wordnet senses for those nominals , suggesting that the system may work usefully in deducing semantic relations between nominals without the need to deduce word senses .
for each sense-pair , the algorithm goes through the corpus of compounds and extracts every compound whose modifier sense -LRB- or a hypernym of that sense -RRB- is equal to the modifier sense in the current sense-pair , and whose
