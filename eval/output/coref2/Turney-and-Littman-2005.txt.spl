the sat college entrance exam contains multiple-choice verbal analogy questions , in which there is a word pair , a : b , and five choices .1 the task is to select the most analogous word pair , c : d , from the set of five word pairs .
although there has been much research on measuring the similarity of individual concepts -LRB- lesk , 1969 ; church and hanks , 1989 ; dunning , 1993 ; smadja , 1993 ; resnik , 1995 ; landauer and dumais , 1997 ; turney , 2001 ; pantel and lin , 2002 -RRB- , there has been relatively little work on measuring the similarity of semantic relationships between concepts -LRB- vanderwende , 1994 ; rosario and hearst , 2001 ; rosario et al. , 2002 ; nastase and szpakowicz , 2003 -RRB- .
in this section , we consider related work on metaphorical and analogical reasoning -LRB- section 2.1 -RRB- , applications of the vector space model -LRB- section 2.2 -RRB- , and research on classifying noun-modifier pairs according to their semantic relations -LRB- section 2.3 -RRB- .
in this paper , we apply a measure of analogical similarity to classifying noun-modifier relations , but , in principle , this could work the other way around ; an algorithm for classifying noun-modifier relations could be used to solve sat-style verbal analogy problems .
we create
contrariwise , a good algorithm for classifying semantic relations should also help to solve verbal analogies , which argues for a strong connection between recognizing analogies and classifying semantic relations .
