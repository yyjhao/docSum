furthermore , it follows , as best as possible the recommendation of the entity and relation classifiers , but also satisfies natural constraints that exist on whether specific entities can be the argument of specific relations , whether two relations can occur together at the same time , or any other information that might be available at the inference time -LRB- e.g. , suppose it is known that entities a and b represent the same location ; one may like to incorporate an additional constraint that prevents an inference of the type : c lives in a ; c does not live in b -RRB- .
given that this is a difficult task which
in addition , some other features are extracted from the target phrase , including : for the relation classifier , there are three sets of features : -LRB- 1 -RRB- features similar to those used in the entity classification are extracted from the two argument entities of sthe relation ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- conjunctions of the features from the two arguments ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- some patterns extracted from the sentence or between the two arguments .
note that lp may change the predictions for either entity labels or relation labels , while pipeline fully trusts the labels of entity classifier , and only the relation predictions may be different from the basic relation classifier .
