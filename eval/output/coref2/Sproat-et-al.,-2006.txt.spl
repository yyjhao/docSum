for training data we have a small list of 721 names in roman script and their chinese equivalent .3 pronunciations for english words are obtained using
in order to compute the similarity between two distribution vectors , the pearson correlation coefficient was used in -LRB- tao and zhai , 2005 -RRB- ; here we also considered two other commonly used measures cosine -LRB- salton and mcgill , 1983 -RRB- , and jensen-shannon divergence -LRB- lin , 1991 -RRB- , though our results show that pearson correlation coefficient performs better than these two other methods .
thus these document pairs and transliteration pairs mutually reinforce each other , and this can be exploited to further optimize our transliteration scores by allowing transliteration pairs to propagate their scores to each other according to their co-occurrence strengths .
in order to see more clearly how accurate each method is for ranking the candidates , we also compute the mrr for the subset of english names whose transliteration answers are in our candidate list .
indeed , although the performance of the frequency correlation method alone is much worse than that of the phonetic correspondence method , when working on the subset of candidates passing the phonetic filter -LRB- i.e. , those candidates that have a reasonable phonetic alignment with the english name -RRB- , it can outperform the phonetic correspondence method .
