although in single document summarization the position of a sentence in a document can provide cues with
barzilay et al. -LRB- 2002 -RRB- address the problem of information ordering in multidocument summarization and show that naive ordering algorithms such as majority ordering -LRB- selects most frequent orders across input documents -RRB- and chronological ordering -LRB- orders facts according to publication date -RRB- do not always yield coherent summaries although the latter produces good results when the information is event - based .
while this is clearly a naive view of text coherence , our model has some notion of the types of sentences that typically go together , even though it is agnostic about the specific rhetorical relations that glue sentences into a coherent text .
although we don t have an explicit model of rhetorical relations and their effects on sentence ordering , we capture the lexical inter-dependencies between sentences by focusing on verbs and their precedence relationships in the corpus .
table 3 gives the average ti -LRB- t -RRB- for all 20 test texts when the following features are used : lemmatized verbs -LRB- vl -RRB- , tensed verbs -LRB- vt -RRB- , lemmatized nouns -LRB- nl -RRB- , lemmatized verbs and nouns -LRB- vlnl -RRB- , tensed verbs and lemmatized nouns -LRB- vtnl -RRB- , verb-related dependencies -LRB- vd -RRB- , noun-related dependencies -LRB- nd -RRB- , verb and noun dependencies -LRB- vdnd -RRB- , and all available dependencies -LRB- ad -RRB- .
