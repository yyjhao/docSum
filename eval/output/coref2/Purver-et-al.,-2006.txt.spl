for each set of annotations , we therefore performed two sets of segmentations : one in which the threshold was set for each meeting to give the known gold - standard number of segments , and one in which the threshold was set on a separate development set to give the overall corpus-wide average number of segments , and held constant for all test meetings .2 this also allows us to compare our results with those of -LRB- galley et al. , 2003 -RRB- , who apply a similar threshold to their lexical
of these lists , 40 contained the most indicative words for each of the 10 topics from different models : the topic segmentation model ; a topic model that had the same number of segments but with fixed evenly spread segmentation boundaries ; an equivalent with randomly placed segmentation boundaries ; and the hmm .
however , while hmm approaches allow a segmentation of the data by topic , they do not allow adaptively combining different topics into segments : while a new segment can be modelled as being identical to a topic that has already been observed , it can not be modelled as a combination of the previously observed topics .1 note that while -LRB- imai et al. , 1997 -RRB- s hmm approach allows topic mixtures , it requires supervision with hand-labelled topics .
