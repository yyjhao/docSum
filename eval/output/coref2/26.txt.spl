the goal of confidence estimation is to compute p -LRB- correct | q , a -RRB- , the probability of answer correctness given a question q and an answer a. a qa system can use the confidence score to decide whether or not to show the user the answer .
for answer selection , we used a hmm-based ir system -LRB- miller et al , 1999 -RRB- to first select documents that are likely to contain answers to a question and then rank candidate answers based on the answer contexts using the same ir system .
using the training questions , we obtained p -LRB- correct | vs is true -RRB- = 0.49 and p -LRB- correct | vs is
the features we used are the answer type of the question , the number of matched question words in the answer context and whether the answer satisfies the verb arguments of the question .
since for the trec2002 qa track each question can only have one answer , we chose the one with the higher confidence score if the web answer and the answer from base system are different for a question .
then the candidates were re-ranked , by applying the following constraints : if the question asks for a number , check whether the answer quantifies the same noun in the answer context as in the question .
