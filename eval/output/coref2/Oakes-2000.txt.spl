the lists of sound correspondences which hold true across all four languages are then used to derive the corresponding sounds in the protolanguage using four principles given by crowley -LRB- 1992 , chapter 5 -RRB- , as follows : proposed
the types of conditions imposed are : positional : e.g. , prothesis must occur at the start of a word ; certain characters must be vowels or consonants , e.g. , vowel breaking can only involve vowels ; certain corresponding characters involved in an operation must be identical , e.g. , in transforming keldai into keledai -LRB- malay and indonesian for donkey -RRB- , the epenthesis ld &gt; led is allowed , since the initial and final characters are identical ; adjacent characters must have at least one phonetic feature -LRB- such as place of articulation -RRB- in common , e.g. , in assimilation ; in the cases of lenition and fortition , corresponding characters must be the stronger and weaker equivalents of each other , as tabulated by crowley -LRB- 1992 , p .
the types of sound change listed by crowley , and the conditions required for their identification , are as follows : forms of deletion and insertion : aphaeresis : deletion of the initial character from word 1 ; prothesis : insertion of the initial character into word 1 ; apocope : deletion of the final character from word 1 ; apocope2 : insertion of the final character into word 1 .
