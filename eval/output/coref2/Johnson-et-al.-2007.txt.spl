in this paper , we show that it is possible to prune phrasetables using a straightforward approach based on significance testing , that this approach does not adversely affect the quality of translation as measured by
phrase translation model probabilities are features of the form : the forward phrase probabilities p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are not used as features , but only as a filter on the set of possible translations : for each source phrase s ~ that matches some ngram in s , only the 30 top-ranked translations t ~ according to p -LRB- ~ tj ~ s -RRB- are retained .
the idea behind significance pruning of phrasetables is that not all of the phrase pairs in a phrasetable are equally supported by the data and that many of the weakly supported pairs could be removed because : the chance of them occurring again might be low , and their occurrence in the given corpus may be the result of an artifact -LRB- a combination of effects where several estimates artificially compensate for one another -RRB- .
since the contingency table with c -LRB- s , ~ t -RRB- = 1 having the greatest significance -LRB- lowest p-value -RRB- is the 1-1-1 table , using the threshold of a + e can be used to exclude all of the phrase pairs occurring exactly once -LRB- c -LRB- 9 , ~ t -RRB- = 1 -RRB- .
