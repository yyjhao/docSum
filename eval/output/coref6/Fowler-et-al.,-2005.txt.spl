in the first stage of our system , the input text and hypothesis are converted into logic forms -LRB- moldovan and rus , 2001 -RRB- .
difficult proofs are those that can not be handled by our theorem
the confidence score for a t-h pair in our system is measured as the distance between the normalized score and the threshold .
before evaluating the t-h pairs in the test set with our system , we manually determined how difficult it is to prove entailment in each of the true entailment t-h pairs .
the system generates the following axiom for this relation : these axioms help the logic prover infer target concepts from starting concepts when lexical chains are found between the two .
our approach attempts to recognize textual entailment by determining if the hypothesis sentence can be logically derived from the text passage using a logic prover .
the hypothesis is negated , and if it then contradicts anything in the text or anything inferred from the text , the prover concludes that the original hypothetical statement is derivable from the text -LRB- thus , entailment exists -RRB- .
the score generated by the logic prover is only a measure of the kinds of axioms used in the proof and the significance of the dropped arguments and predicates .
