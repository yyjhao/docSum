table 7 shows a view opposite to table 6 , that is , instance names that belong to many categories , rather than categories with many instance names .
one of the following situations may occur as illustrated in table 1 : 1 -RRB- no plural-form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 2 -RRB- a plural - form noun phrase exists near the end of the categorical fact , but it is immediately -LRB- e.g. , within 5 tokens -RRB- preceded by another plural-form noun phrase ; the pair -LRB- x , n -RRB- is discarded ; 3 -RRB- otherwise , the noun phrase is retained as the lexicalized category of the instance name n. note that one of the categories selected in table 1 is programming languages rather than other programming languages .
for illustration , according to the set of categorized names that we acquired in an experiment from web documents , the 10 most representative categories for orange are in order : counties , operators , areas , companies , cities , topics and flavors , brands , organizations and colors .
the process continues with a next iteration , in which the new set of patterns generates an expanded set of categorized names , which in turn can be used iteratively to generate another set of potential patterns , as suggested in -LSB- 4 , 23 -RSB- .
