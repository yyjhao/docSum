in a widely cited paper , hearst -LRB- 1992 -RRB- showed that the lexico-syntactic pattern y such as the x can be used to mine large text corpora for word pairs x : y in which x is a hyponym -LRB- type -RRB- of y. for example , if we search in a large corpus using the pattern y such as the x and we find the string bird such as the ostrich , then we can infer that ostrich is a hyponym of bird .
as far as we know , our algorithm is the first unsupervised learning algorithm that can find patterns for semantic relations , given only a large corpus -LRB- e.g. , in our experiments , about 5 x 1010 words -RRB- and a moderately sized set of word pairs -LRB- e.g. , 600 or more pairs in the experiments -RRB- , such that the members of each pair appear together frequently in short phrases in the corpus .
latent relational analysis -LRB- turney , 2005 -RRB- provides a way to measure the relational similarity between two word pairs , but it gives us little insight into how the two pairs are similar .
in table 4 , we compare ranking patterns by pertinence to ranking by various other measures , mostly based on varieties of tf-idf -LRB- term frequency times inverse document frequency , a common way to rank
