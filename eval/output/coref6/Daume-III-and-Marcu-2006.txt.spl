our model can be seen as a constrained experts model , with three experts , where the constraints specify that in-domain data can only come from one of two experts , and out-of-domain data can only come from one of two experts -LRB- with a single expert overlapping between the two -RRB- .
under this modified notation , we may rewrite
applying jensens inequality to the first term in eq -LRB- 9 -RRB- and the variational dual to the second term , we obtain that the change of log-likelihood in moving from model parameters ot-1 at time t 1 to ot at time t -LRB- which we shall denote qt -RRB- is bounded by al &gt; qt , where qt is defined by eq -LRB- 10 -RRB- , where h = -RSB- e -LCB- z i x ; o -RCB- when z = 1 and 1 -RSB- e -LCB- z i x ; o -RCB- when z = 0 , with expectations taken with respect to the parameters from the previous iteration .
mixw : this model is also obtained by training a maximum entropy model on the union of the out-of-domain and in-domain data sets , but where the out-of-domain data is down - weighted so that is effectively equinumerous with the in-domain data .
allowing v to range over -LCB- i , o , g -RCB- , the full hierarchical model is : we term this model the maximum entropy genre adaptation model -LRB- the mega model -RRB- .
