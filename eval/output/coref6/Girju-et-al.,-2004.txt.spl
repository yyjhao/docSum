based on the classification provided by the new websters grammar guide -LRB- semmelmeyer and bolander 1992 -RRB- and our observations of noun phrase patterns on large text collections , the most frequently occurring np level constructions are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- compound nominals consisting of two consecutive nouns -LRB- eg pump drainage - an instrument relation -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- adjective noun constructions where the adjectival modifier is derived from a noun -LRB- eg parental refusal - agent -RRB- , -LRB- 3 -RRB- genitives -LRB- eg tone of conversation - a property relation -RRB- , -LRB- 4 -RRB- adjective phrases in which the modifier noun is expressed by a prepositional phrase which functions as an adjective -LRB- eg amusement in the park - a location relation -RRB- , and -LRB- 5 -RRB- adjective clauses where the head noun is modified by a relative clause -LRB- eg the man who was driving the car - an agent relation between man and driving -RRB- .
by comparing
the criterion of nomlex classification is based on the verb-argument correspondence : verb-nom : the nominalized noun represents the action \/ state of the verb -LRB- e.g. , acquisition challenge , depositary receipt -RRB- , subj-nom : the nominalized noun refers to the subject of the verb -LRB- e.g. , auto maker , math teacher -RRB- .
while these systems focus on verb-argument semantic relations , called semantic roles , in this paper we investigate predicate-argument semantic relations in nominalized noun phrases and present a method for their automatic detection in open-text .
