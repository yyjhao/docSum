to validate this acquisition method , we compared the results of a restricted version of the algorithm with information found in wordnet .2 wordnet -LRB- miller et al. 1990 -RRB- is a hand-built online thesaurus whose organization is modeled after the
furthermore , since we 've assumed the hyponym has only one main sense we could do the following : look through a corpus for occurrences of the hyponym and see if its environment tends to be similar to one of the senses of its hypernym .
initially we discovered patterns -LRB- 1 -RRB- - -LRB- 3 -RRB- by observation , looking through text and noticing the patterns and the relationships they indicate , in order to find new patterns automatically , we sketch the following procedure : decide on a lexical relation , 11 , that is of interest , e.g. , '' group \/ member '' -LRB- in our formulation this is a subset of the hyponymy relation -RRB- .
section 3 of this paper describes an example , comparing results extracted from a text corpus with information stored in the noun hierarchy of wordnet -LRB- -LRB- miller et al. 1990 -RRB- -RRB- , a hand-built lexical thesaurus .
our approach is complementary to statistically based approaches that find semantic relations between terms , in that ours requires a single specially expressed instance of a relation while the others require a statistically significant number of generally expressed relations .
