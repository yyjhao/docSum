definition -LRB- comparative relation -RRB- : a comparative relation captures the essence of a comparative sentence and is represented with the following : -LRB- relationword , features , entitys1 , entitys2 , type -RRB- where relation word : the keyword used to express a comparative relation in a sentence .
sequence data generation : we create a sequence database for mining as follows : since we are interested in predicting and extracting items representing entitys -RSB- -LRB- denoted by $ es -RSB- -RRB- , entitys2 -LRB- denoted by $ es2 -RRB- , and features -LRB- denoted by $ ft -RRB- , non-entity-feature -LRB- denoded by $ nef -RRB- , which are called labels , we first manually label such words in each sentence in the training data .
our results show that lsrs outperform conditional random fields -LRB- crf -RRB- -LRB- lafferty , mccallum &amp; pereira 2001 -RRB- , which is perhaps the most effective extraction method so far -LRB- mooney &amp; bunescu 2005 -RRB- .
in recent years , there was a growing interest in analyzing evaluative texts on the web -LRB- e.g. , pang , lee &amp; vaithyanathan , 2002 ; turney , 2002 ; wilson , yu &amp; hatzivassiloglou 2003 ; wiebe &amp; hwa 2004 ; hu &amp; liu , 2004 ; popescu &amp; etzioni 2005 ; carenini , ng &amp; zwart 2005 ; riloff &amp; wiebe 2005 -RRB- .
