perhaps more encouraging is the result that the combined method where we classify attested instances according to the proposed method , and classify unattested instances according to the nearest-neighbour method of kim and baldwin -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and the classifications from the proposed method outperforms the method of kim and baldwin -LRB- 2005 -RRB- .
section 3 details the set of nc semantic relations that is used in our research , section 4 presents an extended discussion of our approach , section 5 briefly explains the tools we use , section 6.1 describes how we gather and process the data , section 6.2 explains how we map the verbs to seed verbs , and section 7 and section 8 present the results and analysis of our approach .
note that while these pre-defined constructional contexts are based on the contexts in which our seed verbs are predicted to correlate with a given semantic relation , we instances of all verbs occurring in those contexts .
we first parsed each of these corpora using rasp -LRB- briscoe
for a given modifier and head noun , our method extracted corpus instances of the two nouns in a range of constructional contexts , and then mapped the original verbs onto seed verbs based on lexical similarity derived from wordnet : : similarity , and moby s thesaurus .
