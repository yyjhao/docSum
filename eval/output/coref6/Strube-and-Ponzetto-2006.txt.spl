wikipedia mining works in our system as follows : given the word pairs i , j -LRB- king and rook for instance -RRB- we first retrieve the wikipedia pages which they refer to .
since the edge counting approach relies on a uniform modeling of the hierarchy , researchers started to develop measures for computing semantic relatedness which abstract from this problem -LRB- wu &amp; palmer , 1994 ; resnik , 1995 ; leacock &amp; chodorow , 1998 ; finkelstein et al. , 2002 ; banerjee &amp; pedersen , 2003 , inter alia -RRB- .
we evaluate four expanded feature sets , namely adding -LRB- 1 -RRB- wordnet features ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- wikipedia features ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- semantic role label features -LRB- gildea &amp; jurafsky , 2002 , srl -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- all available features .
since the datasets are limited in size , we additionally apply these measures to
in the case of wikipedia we couple the resnik measure with an intrinsic information content measure relying on the hierarchical structure of the category tree -LRB- seco et al. , 2004 -RRB- , rather than computing the information content from the probabilities of occurrence of the concepts in a corpus .
finally , given the set of paths found between the category pairs , we compute the taxonomy based measures by selecting the paths satisfying the measure definitions , namely the shortest path for path-based measures and the path which maximizes information content for information content based measures .
