in this work , we make two independent observations about named entities encountered in such corpora , and use them to develop an algorithm that extracts pairs of nes across languages .
in essence , the algorithm we present uses temporal alignment as a supervision signal to iteratively train a discriminative transliteration model , which can be viewed as a distance metric between and english ne and a potential transliteration .
in keeping with our objective to provide as little language knowledge as possible , we introduced a simplistic approach to identifying transliteration equivalence classes , which sometimes produced erroneous groupings -LRB- e.g. an equivalence class for ne lincoln in russian included both lincoln and lincolnshire on figure 6 -RRB- .
at this point , our algorithm takes a simplistic approach also for the english side of the corpus each unique word had its own equivalence class although , in principle , we can incorporate works such as -LRB- li et al. , 2004 -RRB- into the algorithm .
unless mentioned otherwise , the transliteration model was initialized with a subset of 254 pairs of nes and their transliteration equivalence classes .
for instance , we would like to count the aggregate number of occurrences of herzegovina , hercegovina on the english side in order to map it accurately to the equivalence class of
