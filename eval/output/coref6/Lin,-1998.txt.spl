since probability theory can be integrated with many kinds
since similarity is the ratio between the amount of information in the commonality and the amount of information in the description of the two objects , if we know the commonality of the two objects , their similarity tells us how much more information is needed to determine what these two objects are .
the following are four examples of similarity calculations : the results show that , given the probability distribution in figure 1 , the similarity between excellent and good is much higher than the similarity between good and average ; the similarity between excellent and average is much higher than the similarity between good and bad .
application domains : the similarity measure proposed in this paper can be applied in all the domains listed in table 6 , including the similarity of ordinal values , where none of the other similarity measures is applicable .
since knowing both the commonalities and the differences between a and b means knowing what a and b are , we assume : assumption 2 : the differences between a and b is measured by i -LRB- description -LRB- a , b -RRB- -RRB- | i -LRB- common -LRB- a , b -RRB- -RRB- , where description -LRB- a , b -RRB- is a proposition that describes what a and b are .
