the simplest implementation of such a system can consist of one where f = -LSB- xi -LRB- the length of the document x -RRB- , and where the user is simply asked to highlight relevant words or phrases -LRB- features -RRB- or passages while reading the document in order to label the document -LRB- step 2b -RRB- , akin to the system in the paper by croft and das -LRB- 1990 -RRB- .
we then move on to discuss a real system which employs a two-tiered approach of document feedback and feature feedback like the system in figure 2 which we evaluate using a simulation : we obtain feedback on features and documents apriori , and use the judgments so obtained to measure
following the algorithm for system 3 -LRB- see section 2.2 , figure 3 -RRB- , let f = n -LRB- the total number of features -RRB- and let us assume that the oracle selects the k most important features -LRB- by information gain -RRB- in step 1 .
for an actual use in practice , we prefer an approach that combines feature selection and instance selection -LRB- e.g. , as proposed in section 2.1 -RRB- because it also allows the system to benefit from the increase in the knowledge of the teacher or the process may help remind the teacher about the usefulness of features as she reads the documents .
