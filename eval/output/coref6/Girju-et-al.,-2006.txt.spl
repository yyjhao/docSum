the set of rules represents the rules to be used for classifying the new instances and the default value represents the target value -LRB- yes if an instance is a part-whole relation and no if the instance is not a part-whole relation -RRB- that should be returned if none of the rules classify the new instances .
since the part and whole concepts provided by wordnet can belong to almost any wordnet noun hierarchy , we randomly selected 100 pairs of part-whole concepts that were well distributed over all nine wordnet noun hierarchies , the three wordnet meronymic relations , and the six types of part-whole relations of wch .
the learning tree has two types of nodes : unambiguous nodes , corresponding to the sets of unambiguous examples from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.1 , 1.3.1 , and 1.4.1 from figure 3 -RRB- and ambiguous nodes , corresponding to each ambiguous example from each iteration -LRB- e.g. , nodes 1.2,1.3,1.4 , and 1.4.2 from figure 3 -RRB- .
this pattern classification criterion is justified , in part , by our desire to verify whether or not the automatic approach proposed here is generally applicable not only for the genitive
section 4 describes a method for learning semantic classification rules , while section 5 shows the results obtained for discovering the part-whole relations by applying the classification rules on two distinct test corpora .
