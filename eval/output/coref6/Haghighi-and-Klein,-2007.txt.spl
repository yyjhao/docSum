in all experiments , as is common , we will assume that we have been given as part of our input the true mention boundaries , the head word of each mention and the mention type -LRB- proper
for each mention in the document , we choose a component -LRB- an entity index -RRB- z from q. entity z is then associated with a multinomial emission distribution over head words with parameters ^ hz , which are drawn from a symmetric dirichlet over possible mention heads with concentration ah .2 note that here the x for a mention consists only of the mention head h. as we enrich our models , we simultaneously develop an accompanying gibbs sampling procedure to obtain samples from p -LRB- zix -RRB- .3 for now , all heads h are observed and all parameters -LRB- q and 0 -RRB- can be integrated out analytically : for details see teh et al. -LRB- 2006 -RRB- .
note that in our model the only way an entity becomes associated with an entity type is by the pronouns used to refer to it .12 if we evaluate our system as an unsupervised ner tagger for the proper mentions in the muc-6 test set , it yields a state-of - the-art systems , this result beats a simple baseline of always guessing person -LRB- the most common entity type -RRB- , which yields 46.4 % .
