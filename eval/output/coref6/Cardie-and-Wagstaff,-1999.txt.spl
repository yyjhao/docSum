the subscripted noun phrases in the sample output constitute two noun phrase coreference equivalence classes : class js contains the five noun phrases that refer to john simon , and class pc contains the two noun phrases that represent prime corp. the figure also visually links neighboring coreferent noun phrases .
in contrast to other approaches to coreference resolution , ours is unsupervised and offers several potential advantages over existing methods : no annotated training data is required , the distance metric can be easily extended to account for additional linguistic information as it becomes available to the nlp system , and the clustering approach provides a flexible mechanism for combining a variety of constraints and preferences to impose a partitioning on the noun phrases in a text into coreference equivalence classes .
here we use a simple , overly restrictive heuristic to determine whether or not the noun phrase is in a -LRB- post-posed -RRB- appositive construction : if the noun phrase is surrounded by commas , contains an article , and is immediately preceded by another noun phrase , then it is marked as an appositive .
lastly , the algorithm could rank all possible coreference links -LRB- all pairs of noun phrases in the document -RRB- and then proceed through them in ranked order , thus progressing from the
