lra extends this approach in three ways : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the patterns are generated dynamically from the corpus , -LRB- 2 -RRB- svd is used to smooth the data , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- a thesaurus is used to explore variations of the word pairs .
measures of attributional similarity have been studied extensively , due to their applications in problems such as recognizing synonyms -LRB- landauer and dumais , 1997 -RRB- , information retrieval -LRB- deerwester et al. , 1990 -RRB- , determining semantic orientation -LRB- turney , 2002 -RRB- , grading student essays -LRB- rehder et al. , 1998 -RRB- , measuring textual cohesion -LRB- morris and hirst , 1991 -RRB- , and word sense disambiguation -LRB- lesk , 1986 -RRB- .
the novelty in turney and littman -LRB- 2005 -RRB- is that their patterns are not used to mine text for instances of word pairs that fit the patterns -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; berland and charniak , 1999 -RRB- ; instead , they are used to gather frequency data for building vectors that represent the relation between a given pair of words .
lra is able to answer as many questions as vsm-av , although it uses the same corpus as vsm-wmts , because lins thesaurus allows lra to substitute synonyms
the performance of lra is significantly better than the lexicon-based approach of veale -LRB- 2004 -RRB- -LRB- see section 3.1 -RRB- and the best performance using attributional similarity -LRB- see section 2.3 -RRB- , with 95 % confidence , according to the fisher exact test -LRB- agresti , 1990 -RRB- .
