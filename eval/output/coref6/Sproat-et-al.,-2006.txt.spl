for training data we have a small list of 721 names in roman script and their chinese equivalent .3 pronunciations for english words are obtained using the festival text-tospeech system -LRB- taylor et al. , 1998 -RRB- ; for chinese , we use the standard pinyin transliteration of the characters .
in order to compute the similarity between two distribution vectors , the pearson correlation coefficient was used in -LRB- tao and zhai , 2005 -RRB- ; here we also considered two other commonly used measures cosine -LRB- salton and mcgill , 1983 -RRB- , and jensen-shannon divergence -LRB- lin , 1991 -RRB- , though our results show that pearson correlation coefficient performs better than these two other methods .
indeed , although the performance of
for example , with pearson correlation , when the chinese transliteration of an english name is included in our candidate list , the correct answer is , on average , ranked at the 3rd place or better .
to demonstrate that score propagation can further help transliteration , we use the combination scores in table 3 as the initial scores , and apply our propagation algorithm to iteratively update them .
thus these document pairs and transliteration pairs mutually reinforce each other , and this can be exploited to further optimize our transliteration scores by allowing transliteration pairs to propagate their scores to each other according to their co-occurrence strengths .
