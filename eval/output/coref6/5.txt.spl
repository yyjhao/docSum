rather than using simple heuristics , we present results with two statistical frameworks for addressing this problem : one based on link structure , and another based on the recently introduced
we applied cosine similarity with a novel variation of the tfidf term weighting function : the problem of web appearance disambiguation can be addressed within the standard clustering framework : the set of web pages d is split into m clusters , then one of the clusters is considered as containing only relevant pages while all the other clusters are irrelevant .
since in both solutions of the web appearance disambiguation problem -LRB- link structure method and the a \/ cdc method -RRB- we build one group of relevant web pages , we can attempt to overlap the groups built by the two methods .
it can be seen in the graph that when the recall of the relevant cluster is around 45 % -LRB- there are five clusters overall -RRB- , the precision is very high -LRB- above 98 % -RRB- .3 this cluster contains two pages of bill mark the sri manager and none of the pages of bill mark the utexas professor ; it also contains 15 pages of fernando pereira the upenn professor and only one page of fernando pereira the professor of instituto superior tecnico .
