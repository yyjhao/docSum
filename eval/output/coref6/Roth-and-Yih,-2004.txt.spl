furthermore , it follows , as best as possible the recommendation of the entity and relation classifiers , but also satisfies natural constraints that exist on whether specific entities can be the argument of specific relations , whether two relations can occur together at the same time , or any other information that might be available at the inference time -LRB- e.g. , suppose it is known that entities a and b represent the same location ; one may like to incorporate an additional constraint that prevents an inference of the type : c lives in a ; c does not live in b -RRB- .
we consider a set v which consists of two types of variables v = e ^ r. the first set of variables e = -LCB- e1 , e2 , , en -RCB- ranges l. the value -LRB- called label -RRB- assigned to ei ^ e is denoted fe , ^ l. the second set of variables r = -LCB- rij -RCB- -LCB- 1
given that this is a difficult task which may require quite often information beyond the sentence , we consider also a forced decision task , in which we simulate a question answering situation we ask the system , say , who killed whom and evaluate it on identifying correctly the relation and its arguments , given that it is known that somewhere in this sentence this relation is active .
