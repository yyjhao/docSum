entity word : we also use the lemmas of the words that are part of ei -LRB- i = 1 , 2 -RRB- .
coordination : if the two nouns are the heads of two coordinated nps , we extract the coordinating conjunction .
finally , in a previous publication -LRB- nakov and hearst , 2006 -RRB- , we make the claim that the relation between the nouns in a noun-noun compound can be characterized by the set of intervening verbs extracted from the web .
we then mine the web for sentences containing both noun1 and noun2 , from which we extract features , consisting of word -LRB- s -RRB- , part of speech -LRB- verb , preposition , verb + preposition , coordinating conjunction -RRB- , and whether noun1 precedes noun2 .
girju et al. -LRB- 2005 -RRB- apply svm , decision trees , semantic scattering and iterative semantic specialization , using wordnet , word sense disambiguation , and linguistic features .
regardless of the classifier s prediction , if the head words of the two entities e1 and
in fact , our category c system is the best-performing -LRB- in terms of f and acc -RRB- among the participating systems , and we achieved the third best results for category a. our category c results are slightly but consistently better than for a for all measures -LRB- p , r , features used leave-1-out test ucb f , acc -RRB- , which suggests that knowing the query is helpful .
