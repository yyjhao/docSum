for consistency , we continue to print written english word sequences in italics -LRB- golf ball -RRB- , english sound sequences in all capitals -LRB- g aa l f b ao l -RRB- , japanese sound sequences in lower case -LRB- goruhubooru -RRB- and katakana sequences naturally -LRB- = ' -RRB- 1 -RRB- .
we face two immediate problems : an obvious target inventory is the japanese syllabary itself , written down in katakana -LRB- e.g. , - = -RRB- or a roman equivalent -LRB- e.g. , ni -RRB- .
for each glossary entry , we converted english words into english sounds using the model described in the previous section , and we converted katakana words into japanese sounds using the model we describe in the next section .
we combined corpus analysis with guidelines from a japanese textbook -LRB- jorden and chaplin 1976 -RRB- to turn up many spelling variations and unusual katakana symbols : spelling variation is clearest in cases where an english word like
next comes the poo model , which produces a 28-state \/ 31-arc wfsa whose highest-scoring sequence is : this english string is closest phonetically to the japanese , but we are willing to trade phonetic proximity for more sensical english ; we rescore this vvfsa by composing it with p -LRB- w -RRB- and extract the best translation : other section 1 examples -LRB- aasudee and robaato shyoon renaado -RRB- are translated correctly as earth day and robert sean leonard .
