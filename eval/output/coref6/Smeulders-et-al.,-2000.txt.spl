within each of the two categories , three subclasses can be defined depending on whether the query relates to the spatial content of the image , to the global image information , or to groups of images .
at the same time , the sensory gap between the properties in an image and the properties of the object plays a limiting role in retrieving the content of the image .
5 interpretation and similarity when the information from images is captured in a feature set , there are two possibilities for endowing them with meaning : one derives an unilateral interpretation from the feature set , while the other one compares the feature set with the elements in a given data set on the basis of a similarity function , see fig .
in particular , the workshop correctly stated that '' visual information management systems should not be considered as an application of the existing state of the art -LRB- in computer vision and databases -RRB- to manage and process images '' and that '' computer vision researchers should identify features required for interactive image understanding , rather than their discipline 's current emphasis on automatic techniques '' -LRB- emphasis added -RRB- .
partitionings of the image aim at obtaining more selective features by selecting pixels in a trade-off against having more information
