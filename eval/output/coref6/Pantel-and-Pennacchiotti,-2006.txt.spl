below is a summary of the main contributions of this paper : algorithm for exploiting generic patterns : unlike previous algorithms that require significant manual work to make use of generic patterns , we propose an unsupervised web-filtering method for using generic patterns ; principled reliability measure : we propose a new measure of pattern and instance reliability which enables the use of generic patterns .
following -LRB- pantel et al. 2004 -RRB- , we define the relative recall of system a given system b , ra | b , as : where ra is the recall of a , ca is the number of correct instances extracted by a , c is the -LRB- unknown -RRB- total number of correct instances in the corpus , pa is as precision in our experiments , and | a | is the total number of instances discovered by a. tables 2-8 report the total number of instances , precision , and relative recall of each system on the trec-9 and chem corpora .
other pattern-based algorithms include -LRB- riloff and shepherd 1997 -RRB- , who used a
the key assumption behind espresso is that in very large corpora , like the web , correct instances generated by a generic pattern will be instantiated by some reliable patterns , where reliable patterns are patterns that have high precision but often very low recall -LRB- e.g. , x consists of y for part-of relations -RRB- .
