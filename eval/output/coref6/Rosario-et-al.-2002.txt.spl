if our hypothesis holds -LRB- that ncs that fall within the same category pairs are assigned the same relation -RRB- , then if most of the ncs fall within only a few category pairs then we only need to determine which relations hold between a subset of the
we also analyzed 21 of the 90 cps for which the second noun was h01 -LRB- natural sciences -RRB- ; we decided to analyze this portion of the mesh hierarchy because the ncs with h01 as second noun are frequent in our collection , and because we wanted to test the hypothesis that we do indeed need to descend farther for heterogeneous parts of mesh .
in the following sections we discuss the linguistic motivations behind this approach , the characteristics of the lexical ontology mesh , the use of a corpus to examine the problem space , the method of determining the relations , the accuracy of the results , and the problem of ambiguity .
this fits nicely with our method of describing the ncs with the higher levels of the hierarchy : if most of the ambiguity is at the highest levels -LRB- as these results show -RRB- , information about lexical ambiguity is not lost when we describe the ncs using the higher levels of mesh .
