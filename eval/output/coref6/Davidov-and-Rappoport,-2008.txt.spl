we merge clusters from different hook corpora using the following algorithm : we start from the smallest clusters because we expect these to
there is a large body of related work that deals with discovery of basic relationship types represented in useful resources such as wordnet , including hypernymy -LRB- hearst , 1992 ; pantel et al. , 2004 ; snow et al. , 2006 -RRB- , synonymy -LRB- davidov and rappoport , 2006 ; widdows and dorow , 2002 -RRB- and meronymy -LRB- berland and charniak , 1999 ; girju et al. , 2006 -RRB- .
to avoid the selection of common words as target words , and to avoid targets appearing in pattern instances that are relatively fixed multiword expressions , we sort all target words in a given hook corpus by pointwise mutual information between hook and target , and drop patterns obtained from pattern instances containing the lowest and highest l percent of target words .
unlike most previous work , our hook words are not provided in advance but selected randomly ; the goal in those papers is to discover relationships between given word pairs , while we use hook words in order to discover relationships that generally occur in the corpus .
we present a fully unsupervised algorithm to compute pattern clusters , not requiring any , even implicit , pre - specification of relationship types or word \/ pattern seeds .
