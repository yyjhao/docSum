trained on brown , the lda model gave an accuracy
first , we introduce the approach , considering the general question of how syntactic and semantic generative models might be combined , and arguing that a composite model is necessary to capture the different roles that words can play in a document .
for example , replacing the content words that the model identifies in the second sentence with content words appropriate to the topic of the present paper , we could write : the integrated architecture in this paper combines simple probabilistic syntax and topic-based semantics using generative models .
in addition to running the composite model with t = 200 and c = 20 , we examined two special cases : t = 200 , c = 2 , being a model where the only hmm classes are the start \/ end and semantic classes , and thus equivalent to latent dirichlet allocation -LRB- lda ; -LSB- 6 -RSB- -RRB- ; and t = 1 , c = 20 , being an hmm in which the semantic class distribution does not vary across documents , and simply has a different hyperparameter from the other classes .
here we explore how statistical learning , with no prior knowledge of either syntax or semantics , can discover the difference between function and content words and simultaneously organize words into syntactic classes and semantic topics .
