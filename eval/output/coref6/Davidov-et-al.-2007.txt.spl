given a large corpus -LRB- such as the web -RRB- and two or more examples of some concept x , automatically generate examples of one or more relations r c x x y , where y is some concept and r is some binary relationship between elements of x and elements of y. studying relationships between tagged named entities , -LRB- hasegawa et al , 2004 ; hassan et al , 2006 -RRB- proposed unsupervised clustering methods that assign given -LRB- or semi-automatically extracted -RRB- sets of pairs into several clusters , where each cluster corresponds to one of a known relationship type .
in this paper , we introduce a novel extension of this problem : given a particular concept -LRB- initially represented by two seed words -RRB- , discover relations in which it participates , without specifying their types in
for purposes of evaluation , we ran our algorithm on three representative domains -- countries , fish species and star constellations -- and tracked down gold standard resources -LRB- encyclopedias , academic texts , informative websites , etc -RRB- for the bulk of the relations generated in each domain .
the first step is to take the seed , which might consist of as few as two concept words , and generate many -LRB- ideally , all , when the concept is a closed set of words -RRB- members of the class to which they belong .
