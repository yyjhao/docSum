we would like to know , therefore , whether the pattern of pronoun references that we observe for a given referent is the result of our supposed '' hypothesis about pronoun reference '' - that is , the pronoun reference strategy we have provisionally adopted in order to gather statistics - or whether the result of some other unidentified process .
the impact of this probability can be seen more clearly from another experiment in which we tested the program -LRB- using just hobbs distance and gender information -RRB- on the training data .
after we have identified the correct antecedents it is a simple counting procedure to compute p -LRB- plwa -RRB- where wo is in the correct antecedent for the pronoun p -LRB- note the pronouns are grouped by their gender -RRB- : when there are multiple relevant words in the antecedent we apply the likelihood test designed by dunning -LRB- 1993 -RRB- on all the words in the candidate np .
where f -LRB- p -RRB- denotes a function from pronouns to their antecedents : f -LRB- p -RRB- = arg mcax p -LRB- a -LRB- p -RRB- = alp , h , , t , 1 , s p , ci , la -RRB- where a -LRB- p -RRB- is a random variable denoting the referent of the pronoun p and a is a proposed antecedent .
following this , we show the results of applying this
