we designed and implemented a system that can automatically group the returned citations from a search engine person-name query , such that each group of citations refers to the same
in our research we apply classification ideas , but we classify returned citations without knowing in advance how many different persons a person-name query will yield .
we entered each name as a query in our system , and the system returned the grouping result for the first 50 returned citations for each name .
section 3 introduces our multi-faceted approach to solving the problem by explaining the three facets we use -LRB- attributes , links , and page similarity -RRB- , showing how to construct a confidence matrix for each facet and how to combine all the confidence matrices into a final confidence matrix , and giving the algorithm we use to group returned citations .
for example , we estimate p -LRB- same person = yes i share2 = yes -RRB- , which is the probability that two citations refer to the same person knowing that the web pages referenced by them share exactly two adjacent cap-word pairs in our training set , by dividing the number of citation pairs that are related to the same person and share two cap-word pairs by the number of citation pairs that share two cap-word pairs .
