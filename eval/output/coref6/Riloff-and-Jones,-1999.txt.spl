the heart of our approach is a mutual bootstrapping technique that learns extraction patterns from the seed words and then exploits the learned extraction patterns to identify more words that belong to the semantic category .
we also introduce a second level of bootstrapping that retains only the most reliable
we also plan to consider schemes for allowing both the semantic lexicon and the extraction patterns to vote on possible extractions .
in the second experiment -LRB- lexicon -RRB- , we manually filtered the semantic lexicon to remove incorrect entries and then extracted every noun phrase in the test set that contained a lexicon entry .
we preprocessed the web pages first by removing html tags and adding periods to separate independent phrases .3 autoslog generated 19,690 candidate extraction patterns from the web page training set , and 14,064 candidate extraction patterns from the terrorism training set .4 then we ran the meta-bootstrapping algorithm on three semantic categories for the web pages -LRB- locations , person titles , and companies -RRB- , and two semantic categories for the terrorism articles -LRB- locations and weapons -RRB- .
our bootstrapping method has two advantages over previous techniques for learning information extraction dictionaries : both a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns are acquired simultaneously , and no special training resources are needed .
