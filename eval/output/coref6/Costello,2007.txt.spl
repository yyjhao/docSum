this compound disambiguation system -LRB- named pro , for proportional relation occurrence ; see costello , veale , &amp; dunne , 2006 -RRB- makes use of a corpus of 2,500 compounds annotated with word - net senses and covering 139 different semantic relations , with each noun and each relation annotated with its correct wordnet sense .1 section 2 of the paper will describe the format and structure of this corpus , section 3 will describe the original pro compound disambiguation system , and section 4 will explain how the pro system was adapted to deduce the correct semantic relation between a pair of nominals , as in semeval task 4 .
instead of using wordnet senses for the input words the system simply used the first -LRB- most frequent -RRB- noun senses for those words , and proceeded as described above .
the system s best performance represents an accuracy of 66 % across relations : in other words , the system gets 1 in three relations wrong in the semeval task .
the algorithm uses the corpus of annotated noun-noun compounds and , to disambiguate a compound , takes as input the correct wordnet sense for the modifier and head words of that compound -LRB- if known -RRB- plus all hypernyms of those senses .
version a of the system used neither the wordnet sense tags nor the
