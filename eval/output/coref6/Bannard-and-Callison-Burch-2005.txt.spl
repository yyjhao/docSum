because we wanted to test our method independently of the quality of word alignment algorithms , we also developed a gold standard of word alignments
in this paper we have introduced a novel method for extracting paraphrases , which we believe greatly increases the usefulness of paraphrasing in nlp applications .
much previous work on extracting paraphrases -LRB- barzilay and mckeown , 2001 ; barzilay and lee , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2003 -RRB- has focused on finding identifying contexts within aligned monolingual sentences from which divergent text can be extracted , and treated as paraphrases .
section 3 describes our experimental setup and includes information about how phrases were selected , how we manually aligned parts of the bilingual corpus , and how we evaluated the paraphrases .
as mentioned in section 1 , the way that we extract paraphrases is the converse of the methodology employed in word sense disambiguation work that uses parallel corpora -LRB- diab and resnik , 2002 -RRB- .
we evaluated the accuracy of top ranked paraphrases when the paraphrase probability was calculated using the manual alignments , the automatic alignments , automatic alignments produced over multiple corpora in different languages , all of the above with language model re-ranking , all of the above with the candidate paraphrases limited to the same sense as the original phrase .
