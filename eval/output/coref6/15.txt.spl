this paper presents a novel approach to answer validation
considering these figures and the negligible distance in the success rates of the two approaches -LRB- statistical prevails with only 0.4 % -RRB- we may suppose that in the data-driven approaches for answer validation the data is more significant than the methodology .
the retrieved documents are then used for determine an answer validation score as the composition of two alternative answer validation techniques , namely a statistical approach and a content-based approach .
compute the set of representative keywords and both from and from , this step is carried out using linguistic techniques , such as answer type identification -LRB- from the question -RRB- and named entities recognition -LRB- from the answer -RRB- ; from the extracted keywords compute the validation pattern for the pair ; submit the validation pattern to a search engine ; estimate an answer relevance score -LRB- ars -RRB- considering the results returned by the search engine .
in the first text snippet the distance between the candidate answer 1890 and all the question keywords -LRB- idaho , became and state -RRB- is 0 , since only stop-words are present between the candidate answer and the question keywords .
for each question type we report in table 3 precision -LRB- p -RRB- , recall -LRB- r -RRB- and success rate -LRB- sr -RRB- for both the content-based and the statistical approach .
