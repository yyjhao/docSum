we did not utilize wikipedias category sections in this study , since a wikipedia article can have more than one category , and many of them are not clean hypernyms of the entity as far as we observed .
in our experiments using the conll 2003 ner dataset -LRB- tjong et al. , 2003 -RRB- , we demonstrate that we can improve performance by using the wikipedia features by 1.58 points in f-measure from the baseline , and by 1.21 points from the model that only uses the gazetteers provided in the conll 2003 dataset .
for example , given the sentence , rare jimi hendrix song draft sells for almost $ 17,000 , we would like to know that jimi hendrix is described in
we can see that gazzetta dello sport in the sentence was correctly labeled as an entity of org category by model -LRB- e -RRB- , because the wikipedia feature identified it as a newspaper entity.an issue , which we should treat , is the disambiguation of ambiguous entities .
we extracted a category label from the first sentence of a wikipedia article and used it as a feature of a crf-based ne tagger .
we compiled these files into one gazetteer , where each entry has its entity category , and used it in the same way as the wikipedia feature described in section 3.3 .
