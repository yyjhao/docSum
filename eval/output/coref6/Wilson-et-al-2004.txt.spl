to test our hypotheses , we performed the experiments under different settings , varying three factors : the learning algorithm used to train the classifiers , the
research in automatic opinion and sentiment recognition includes distinguishing subjective from objective language -LRB- yu and hatzivassiloglou , 2003 ; riloff et al. , 2003 ; riloff and wiebe , 2003 -RRB- , distinguishing positive from negative language -LRB- yu and hatzivassiloglou , 2003 ; turney and littman , 2003 ; pang et al. , 2002 ; dave et al. , 2003 ; nasukawa and yi , 2003 ; morinaga et al. , 2002 -RRB- , and recognizing particular types of attitudes -LRB- gordon et al. , 2003 ; liu et al. , 2003 -RRB- .
for all learning algorithms and all clause levels , removing the syntax clues results in a significant difference in mse -LRB- compare rows 6 and 7 in table 1 , rows 1 and 2 in table 2 , and rows 3 and 4 in table 2 -RRB- .
clues that occur in the subjective set at least y times more than in the objective set are considered somewhat reliable -LRB- y is tuned on the development data and is set to 4 in our experiments -RRB- , and the rest are rejected as not useful clues .
to adapt the clues to strength classification , we use the annotations in the training data to filter the clues and organize them into new sets based on strength .
