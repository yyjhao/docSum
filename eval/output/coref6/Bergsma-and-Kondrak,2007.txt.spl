in section 6 , we show significant improvements over traditional approaches , as well as significant gains over more recent techniques by ristad and yianilos -LRB- 1998 -RRB- , tiedemann -LRB- 1999 -RRB- , kondrak -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , and klementiev and roth -LRB- 2006 -RRB- .
if two words must have lcsr &gt; 0.58 to be cognate , then for a given word f e f , we need only consider as possible cognates the subset of words in e having an lcsr with f larger than 0.58 , a set we call ef .
notice that unlike traditional similarity measures that always score identical words higher than all other pairs , by virtue of
across all the test sets , this modification results in a 6 % average gain in performance over baseline kr , but is still on average 5 % below the alignment - based discriminative technique , with a statistically significantly difference on each of the nine sets .6 figure 2 shows the relationship between training data size and performance in our bitext-based french-english data .
for the dictionary-based cognate identification , we use french , spanish , german , greek -LRB- gr -RRB- , japanese -LRB- jp -RRB- , and russian -LRB- rs -RRB- to english translation pairs from the freelang program .3 the latter three pairs were chosen so that we can evaluate on more distant languages that use non-roman alphabets -LRB- although the r ^ omaji japanese is romanized by definition -RRB- .
