show that by translating paraphrases we achieve a marked improvement in coverage and translation quality , especially in the case of unknown words which
we augmented the baseline model by incorporating the paraphrase probability into an additional feature function which assigns values as follows : just as we did in the baseline system , we performed minimum error rate training to set the weights of the nine feature functions in our translation model that exploits paraphrases .
for those items judged to have the same meaning as the gold standard phrases we could track how many would have contributed to a higher bleu score -LRB- that is , which of them were exactly the same as the reference translation phrase , or had some words in common with the reference translation phrase -RRB- .
we produced translations under five conditions for each of our training corpora : a set of baseline translations without any additional entries in the phrase table , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases for unseen source words along with paraphrase probabilities , a condition where we added the translations of paraphrases of multi-word phrases along with paraphrase probabilities , and two additional conditions where we added the translations of paraphrases of single and multi-word paraphrase without paraphrase probabilities .
