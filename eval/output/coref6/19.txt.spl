there are three basic considerations : a -RRB- there may be a limited amount of data -LRB- text -RRB- available for development of data-driven techniques ; b -RRB- in a restricted domain , the text includes both domain-specific terms , and general english terms that carry domain-specific meanings ; c -RRB- if the domain is narrow enough , it may be possible to model the domain semantics with reasonable human effort .
for the prototype system we decribe here , a new component is created which takes the key predicates as input , as well as a set of documents provided by the retrieval strategist
the actual sentences that gave rise to these facts are shown below , with the mentioned chemical weapons in italics , and the filename of the original cns corpus document given in parentheses for each sentence : the ix also found facts about egypts delivery of chemical weapons to third parties , and egypts battlefield use of such weapons , both of which might satisfy the information need with the help of some inference .
in this paper , we described a set of extensions to the javelin qa system which support the use of domain semantics -LRB- ontologies and semantic annotations -RRB- for question answering that is based on key predicates and fact matching , rather than keywords and string matching .
