next , we iterate through each of the possible hypernym synsets l under which we might add the new word i ; for each synset l we compute the change in taxonomy score resulting from adding the implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- required by the taxonomic constraints of t. since typically our set of all evidence involving i will be much smaller than the set of possible relations in i -LRB- h1 gl -RRB- , we may efficiently check whether , for each sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , for all words where we have some evidence ergw , whether s participates in some relation with i in the set of implied relations i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- .7 if there is more than one sense s e senses -LRB- w -RRB- , we add to i -LRB- h1gl -RRB- the single relationship rgs that maximizes the taxonomy likelihood , i.e. argmaxs ^ senses -LRB- w -RRB- at -LRB- rgs -RRB- .
in section 2.1 we introduce our definitions for taxonomies , relations , and the taxonomic constraints that enforce dependencies between relations ; in section 2.2 we give a probabilistic model for defining the conditional probability of a set of relational evidence given a taxonomy ; in section 2.3 we formulate a local search algorithm to find the taxonomy maximizing this conditional probability ; and in section 2.4 we extend our framework to deal with
