our approach is a synthesis of techniques developed by barzilay and mckeown -LRB- 2001 -RRB- and lin and pantel -LRB- 2001 -RRB- , designed to overcome the limitations of both .
based on aligned monolingual corpora , our technique for extracting paraphrases builds on lin and pantels insight of using dependency paths -LRB- derived from parsing -RRB- as the fundamental unit of learning and using parts of those paths as features .
sentence alignment was performed using the gale and church algorithm -LRB- 1991 -RRB- with the following cost function : to test the accuracy of our alignment , we manually aligned 454 sentences from two different versions of chapter 21 from twenty thousand leagues under the sea and compared the results of our automatic alignment algorithm against the manually generated gold standard .
the initial default score of any paraphrase is one -LRB- assuming perfect anchor matches -RRB- , but for
similar to the work of barzilay and lee -LRB- 2003 -RRB- , who have applied paraphrase generation techniques to comparable corpora consisting of different newspaper articles about the same event , we are currently attempting to solve the data sparseness problem by extending our approach to non-parallel corpora .
6 paraphrases and question answering the ultimate goal of our work on paraphrases is to enable the development of high-precision question answering system -LRB- cf .
