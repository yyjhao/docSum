depbank was constructed by parsing the selected section 23 wsj sentences with the xle system and outputting syntactic features and bilexical relations from the f-structure found by the parser .
here we compare the accuracy of our parser with kaplan
to build the parsing module , the unification grammar is automatically converted into an atomiccategoried context free backbone , and a non - deterministic lalr -LRB- 1 -RRB- table is constructed from this , which is used to drive the parser .
table 1 shows accuracy results for each individual relation and feature , starting with the gr bilexical relations in the extended depbank and followed by most depbank features reported by kaplan et al. , and finally overall macro - and mi 4.3 evaluation issues the depbank num feature on nouns is evaluated by kaplan et al. on the grounds that it is semantically-relevant for applications .
we speculate that we achieve these results because our system is engineered to make minimal use of lexical information both in the grammar and in parse ranking , because the grammar has been developed to constrain ambiguity despite this lack of lexical information , and because we can compute the full packed parse forest for all the test sentences efficiently -LRB- without sacrificing speed of processing with respect to other statistical parsers -RRB- .
