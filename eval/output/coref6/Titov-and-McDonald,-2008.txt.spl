though results on web-blog posts are encouraging , it is not clear if their method can model sentiments towards discovered topics : induced distributions of the sentiment words are universal and independent of topics , and their model uses the bag-of-words assumption , which does not permit exploitation of co-occurrences of sentiment words with topical words .
top words for the discovered local topics and for some of the global topics of mg-lda models are presented in table 2 - table 3 , one topic per line , along with selected topics from the lda models .7 we manually assigned labels to coherent topics to reflect our interpretation of their meaning .
we propose a model called multi-grain lda -LRB- mg-lda -RRB- , which models two distinct types of topics : global topics and local topics .
for the hotels reviews we present results of the mg-lda model with 15 local topics and 45 global topics and results of the lda model with 45 topics .
for the qualitative analysis we present a number of topics generated by both standard topic models and our new multi-grained topic models to show that the multi-grain topics are both more coherent as well as better correlated with ratable aspects of an object .
the model is defined by parameters ^ , ^ and ^ , where ^ z is the distribution p -LRB- w | z -RRB- of
