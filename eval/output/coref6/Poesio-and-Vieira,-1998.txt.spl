although these definite descriptions would have been classified by hawkins as larger situation uses , in many cases they couldnt really be considered hearer-old or unused : what seems to be happening in these cases is that the writer assumed the reader would use information about the visual form of words , or perhaps lexical knowledge , to infer that an object of that name existed in the world .
this version of the system finds a classification for 355
we observed two problems about the task of classifying definite descriptions : first , neither of the more complex classification schemes we tested resulted in a very good agreement among annotators ; and second , even the task of identifying the antecedent of discourse-related definite descriptions -LRB- i.e. , co-referential and bridging -RRB- is problematicwe only obtained an acceptable agreement in the case of co-referential definite descriptions , and it was difficult for our annotators to choose a single antecedent for a definite description when both bridging and co-reference are allowed .
third , we did not include a class for immediate situation uses , since we assumed they would be rare in written text .1 ~ we also introduced a separate class of idioms including indirect references , idiomatic expressions and metaphorical uses , and we allowed our subjects to mark definite descriptions as doubts .
