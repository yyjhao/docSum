we have implemented a logic prover , called cogex -LRB- from the permutation of the first two syllables of the verb excogitate -RRB- which uniformly codifies the question and answer text , as well as world knowledge resources , in order to use its inference engine to verify and extract any lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers .
in addition to the logic representations of questions and candidate answers , the qa logic prover needs world knowledge axioms to link question concepts to answer concepts .
wordnet supplies us with that chain such that develop make and make create question being derived in their positive form so the proof by contradiction succeeds , which is indicated by the $ f in the final step and the hyperresolution of all the derived terms with the negated question from step 1 of the proof .
, microsoft is referred to as microsoft corp. an axiom is built such that each noun of the complex nominal takes
the qa system includes traditional modules such as question processing , document retrieval , answer extraction , built in ontologies , as well as many tools such as syntactic parser , name entity recognizer , word sense disambiguation -LRB- moldovan and noviscki 2002 -RRB- , logic representation of text -LRB- moldovan and rus 2001 -RRB- and others .
