lee -LSB- 7 , 8 , 91 proposed a statistical transliteration model based on the statistical translation model-1 by brown -LSB- 2 -RSB- that uses only a simple information source of a word
table 1 shows the estimated recall values for the 10best results generated by the tagger and for the case when transcription automata used as well .
section 4 provides experimental results , and finally , we state our conclusions .
for example , the english phonetic unit '' u @ '' can be mapped to a korean phonetic unit -LSB- u @ -RSB- '' or '' 1 -LSB- w @ 1 '' even though the composition of each unit mapping of '' u '' and can result in other composite mappings such as '' - ph -LSB- ju @ -RSB- '' , '' -1 0 -RSB- -LSB- wi @ i '' , -LSB- wujal '' , etc .
the tagging model proposed in this paper exploits not only simple pronunciation unit-to-unit mapping from english to korean , but also more complex contextual information of multiple units mapping .
in this paper , we present a statistical method to transliterate english words in korean alphabet to generate various candidates .
lee 's model is a fully statistical approach even in pronunciation unit alignment and syllabification that may cause inaccurate results , while we use a heuristic approach in pronunciation unit alignment .
first of all , we generate a mapping between english and korean phonetic unit pairs -LRB- table 6 -RRB- .
