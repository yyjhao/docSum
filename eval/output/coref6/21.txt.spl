each name is modelled as a partition in a bipartite graph , with each token in that name as a vertex -LRB- see figure 2 -RRB- and there is a solid directed edge between two tokens -LRB- from the vertex in the smaller partition to the vertex in the larger
in its most general form , our model assumes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- a joint distribution over entities , so that a document that mentions president kennedy is more likely to mention oswald or white house than roger clemens ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- an author model , which makes sure that at least one mention of a name in a document is easily identifiable -LRB- after all , that is the authors goal -RRB- , and then generates other mentions via -LRB- 3 -RRB- an appearance model , governing how mentions are transformed from the representative mention .
our first model is a discriminative approach that models the problem as that of deciding whether any two names mentioned in a collection of documents represent the same entity .
training set of 600 names -LRB- each of the 5 test sets corresponds to a different training set -RRB- , we generated positive training examples using all co-referring pairs of names , and negative examples by randomly selecting pairs of names that do not refer to the same entity .
