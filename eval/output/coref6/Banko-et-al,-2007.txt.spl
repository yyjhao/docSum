for each parsed sentence , the system finds all base noun phrase constituents ei .2 for each pair of noun phrases -LRB- ei , ej -RRB- , i &lt; j , the system traverses the parse structure connecting them to locate a sequence of words that becomes a potential relation ri , j in the tuple t .
for example , the cluster of 4 tuples below describes 2 distinct relations r1 and r2 between bletchley park and station x as delineated below : overall , we found that roughly one quarter of the tuples in our sample were reformulations of
even though they were run over the same 9 million page corpus , textrunner s distributed extraction process took a total of 85 cpu hours , to perform extraction for all relations in the corpus at once , whereas knowitall , which analyzed all sentences in the corpus that potentially matched its rules , took an average of 6.3 hours per relation .
specifically , the tuples we evaluated met the following criteria : 1 -RRB- textrunner assigned a probability of at least 0.8 to the tuple ; 2 -RRB- the tuple s relation is supported by at least 10 distinct sentences in the corpus ; 3 -RRB- the tuple s relation is not found to be in the top 0.1 % of relations by number of supporting sentences .
