our corpus was compiled from three data sources that have been previously used for paraphrase induction -LRB- barzilay and mckeown 2001 ; pang , knight , and marcu 2003 ; dolan , quirk , and brockett 2004 -RRB- : the multiple-translation chinese -LRB- mtc -RRB- corpus , jules vernes twenty thousand leagues under the sea novel -LRB- leagues -RRB- , and the microsoft research -LRB- msr -RRB- paraphrase corpus .
our annotators -LRB- two linguistics graduates -RRB- were given pairs of sentences and asked to show which parts of these were in correspondence by aligning them on a word-byword basis .7 our definition of alignment was fairly general -LRB- och and ney 2003 -RRB- : given a source string x = x1 , ... , xn and a target string y = y1 , ... , ym , an alignment a between two word strings is the subset of the cartesian product of the word positions : we did not provide a formal definition of what constitutes a correspondence .
our phrase extraction procedure distinguishes between two types of phrase pairs : atomic , that is , the smallest possible phrase pairs , and composite , which can be created by combining smaller phrase pairs .
tables 3 and 4 display agreement statistics on our three corpora using precision , recall , f1 , and c. specifically , we estimate c by aggregating ^ and ^ 0 into corpus - level estimates .
in addition , we obtained a trial set of 50
