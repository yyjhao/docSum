carpuat and wu -LRB- 2005 -RRB- integrated the translation predictions from a chinese wsd system -LRB- carpuat et al. , 2004 -RRB- into a chinese - english word-based statistical mt system using the isi rewrite decoder -LRB- germann , 2003 -RRB- .
to achieve this , when a grammar rule r is considered during decoding , and we recognize that some of the terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in a are also chosen by the wsd system as translations for some terminal symbols -LRB- words -RRB- in - y , we compute the following features : note that we can take the negative logarithm of the rule \/ derivation weights and think of them as costs rather than probabilities .
second , the match must contain at least
for local collocations , we use 3 features , w _ 1w + 1 , w _ 1 , and w + 1 , where w _ 1 -LRB- w + 1 -RRB- is the token immediately to the left -LRB- right -RRB- of the current ambiguous word occurrence w .
after wsd , the ith word ci in every chinese sentence may have up to 3 sets of associated translations provided by the wsd system : a set of translations for ci as a single word , a second set of translations for ci _ 1ci considered as a single unit , and a third set of translations for cici + 1 considered as a single unit .
