in this article , we present the concept of sentence fusion , a novel text-to-text generation technique which , given a set of similar sentences , produces a new sentence containing the information common to most sentences in the set .
in looking at the two sentences from which this summary sentence was drawn , we can see that there is a good amount of overlap between the two , but the component does not have enough information about the referents of the different terms to know that two different studies are involved and that fusion should not take place .
using the alignment-based similarity score described in section 3.1.2 , we identify the centroid by computing for each sentence the average similarity score between the sentence and the rest of the input sentences , then selecting the sentence with the highest score .
for example , the fifth sentence in table 4 palestinians fired antitank missile at a bulldozer to build a new embankment in the areais not a well-formed sentence ; however , our language model gave it a better score than its well-formed alternatives
content selection occurs primarily in the first phase , in which our algorithm uses local alignment across pairs of parsed sentences , from which we select fragments to be included in the fusion sentence .
