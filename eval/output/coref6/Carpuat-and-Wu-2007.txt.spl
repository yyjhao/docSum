4.5 integrating wsd predictions in phrase-based smt architectures it is non-trivial to incorporate wsd into an existing phrase-based architecture such as pharaoh -LRB- koehn , 2004 -RRB- , since the decoder is not set up
in this paper , we present first results with a new architecture that integrates a state-of-the-art wsd model into phrase-based smt so as to perform multi-word phrasal lexical disambiguation , and show that this new wsd approach not only produces gains across all available chinese-english iwslt06 test sets for all eight commonly used automated mt evaluation metrics , but also produces statistically significant gains on the much larger nist chinese-english task .
in addition to the widely used bleu -LRB- papineni et al. , 2002 -RRB- and nist -LRB- doddington , 2002 -RRB- scores , we also evaluate translation quality with the recently proposed meteor -LRB- banerjee and lavie , 2005 -RRB- and four edit-distance style metrics , word error rate -LRB- wer -RRB- , position - independent word error rate -LRB- per -RRB- -LRB- tillmann et al. , 1997 -RRB- , cder , which allows block reordering -LRB- leusch et al. , 2006 -RRB- , and translation edit rate -LRB- ter -RRB- -LRB- snover et al. , 2006 -RRB- .
we have proposed to consistently integrate wsd models both during training , where sense definitions and sense-annotated data are automatically extracted from the word-aligned parallel corpora from smt training , and during testing , where the phrasal wsd probabilities are used by the smt system just like all the other lexical choice features .
