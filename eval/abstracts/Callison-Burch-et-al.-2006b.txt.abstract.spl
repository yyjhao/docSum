parallel corpora are crucial for training smt systems .
however , for many language pairs they are available only in very limited quantities .
for these language pairs a huge portion of phrases encountered at run-time will be unknown .
we show how techniques from paraphrasing can be used to deal with these otherwise unknown source language phrases .
our results show that augmenting a state- of-the-art smt system with paraphrases leads to significantly improved coverage and translation quality .
for a training corpus with 10,000 sentence pairs we increase the coverage of unique test set unigrams from 48 % to 90 % , with more than half of the newly covered items accurately translated , as opposed to none in current approaches .
