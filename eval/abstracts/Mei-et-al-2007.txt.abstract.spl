in this paper , we define the problem of topic-sentiment analysis on weblogs and propose a novel probabilistic model to capture the mixture of topics and sentiments simultaneously .
the proposed topic-sentiment mixture ( tsm ) model can reveal the latent topical facets in a weblog collection , the subtopics in the results of an ad hoc query , and their associated sentiments .
it could also provide general sentiment models that are applicable to any ad hoc topics .
with a specifically designed hmm structure , the sentiment models and topic models estimated with tsm can be utilized to extract topic life cycles and sentiment dynamics .
empirical experiments on different weblog datasets show that this approach is effective for modeling the topic facets and sentiments and extracting their dynamics from weblog collections .
the tsm model is quite general ; it can be applied to any text collections with a mixture of topics and sentiments , thus has many potential applications , such as search result summarization , opinion tracking , and user behavior prediction .
