automatic transliteration problem is to transcribe foreign words in one 's own alphabet .
machine generated transliteration can be useful in various applications such as indexing in an information retrieval system and pronunciation synthesis in a text-to-speech system .
in this paper we present a model for statistical englishto-korean transliteration that generates transliteration candidates with probability .
the model is designed to utilize various information sources by extending a conventional markov window .
also , an efficient and accurate method for alignment and syllabification of pronunciation units is described .
the experimental results show a recall of 0.939 for trained words and 0.875 for untrained words when the best 10 candidates are considered .
