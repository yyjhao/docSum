this paper presents a simple unsupervised learning algorithm for classifying reviews as recommended ( thumbs up ) or not recommended ( thumbs down ) .
the classification of a review is predicted by the average semantic orientation of the phrases in the review that contain adjectives or adverbs .
a phrase has a positive semantic orientation when it has good associations ( e.g. , " subtle nuances " ) and a negative semantic orientation when it has bad associations ( e.g. , " very cavalier " ) .
in this paper , the semantic orientation of a phrase is calculated as the mutual information between the given phrase and the word " excellent " minus the mutual information between the given phrase and the word " poor " . a review is classified as recommended if the average semantic orientation of its phrases is positive .
the algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 74 % when evaluated on 410 reviews from epinions , sampled from four different domains ( reviews of automobiles , banks , movies , and travel destinations ) .
the accuracy ranges from 84 % for automobile reviews to 66 % for movie reviews .
