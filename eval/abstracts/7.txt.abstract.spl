semantic similarity measures play important roles in information retrieval and natural language processing .
previous work in semantic web-related applications such as community mining , relation extraction , automatic meta data extraction have used various semantic similarity measures .
despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications , robustly measuring semantic similarity between two words ( or entities ) remains a challenging task .
we propose a robust semantic similarity measure that uses the information available on the web to measure similarity between words or entities .
the proposed method exploits page counts and text snippets returned by a web search engine .
we define various similarity scores for two given words p and q , using the page counts for the queries p , q and p and q. moreover , we propose a novel approach to compute semantic similarity using automatically extracted lexico-syntactic patterns from text snippets .
these different similarity scores are integrated using support vector machines , to leverage a robust semantic similarity measure .
experimental results on miller-charles benchmark dataset show that the proposed measure outperforms all the existing web-based semantic similarity measures by a wide margin , achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.834 .
moreover , the proposed semantic similarity measure significantly improves the accuracy ( f-measure of 0.78 ) in a community mining task , and in an entity disambiguation task , thereby verifying the capability of the proposed measure to capture semantic similarity using web content .
