text clustering is most commonly treated as a fully automated task without user feedback .
however , a variety of researchers have explored mixed-initiative clustering methods which allow a user to interact with and advise the clustering algorithm .
this mixed-initiative approach is especially attractive for text clustering tasks where the user is trying to organize a corpus of documents into clusters for some particular purpose ( e.g. , clustering their email into folders that reflect various activities in which they are involved ) .
this paper introduces a new approach to mixed-initiative clustering that handles several natural types of user feedback .
we first introduce a new probabilistic generative model for text clustering ( the speclustering model ) and show that it outperforms the commonly used mixture of multinomials clustering model , even when used in fully autonomous mode with no user input .
we then describe how to incorporate four distinct types of user feedback into the clustering algorithm , and provide experimental evidence showing substantial improvements in text clustering when this user feedback is incorporated .
