consumers are often forced to wade through many on-line reviews in order to make an informed product choice .
this paper introduces opine , an unsupervised information- extraction system which mines reviews in order to build a model of important product features , their evaluation by reviewers , and their relative quality across products .
compared to previous work , opine achieves 22 % higher precision ( with only 3 % lower recall ) on the feature extraction task .
opines novel use of relaxation labeling for finding the semantic orientation of words in context leads to strong performance on the tasks of finding opinion phrases and their polarity .
