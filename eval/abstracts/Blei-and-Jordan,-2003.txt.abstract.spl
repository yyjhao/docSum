we consider the problem of modeling annotated datadata with multiple types where the instance of one type ( such as a caption ) serves as a description of the other type ( such as an image ) .
we describe three hierarchical probabilistic mixture models which aim to describe such data , culminating in correspondence latent dirichlet allocation , a latent variable model that is effective at modeling the joint distribution of both types and the conditional distribution of the annotation given the primary type .
we conduct experiments on the corel database of images and captions , assessing performance in terms of held-out likelihood , automatic annotation , and text-based image retrieval .
