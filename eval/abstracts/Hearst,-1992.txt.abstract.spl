we describe a method for the automatic acquisition of the hyponymy lexical relation from unrestricted text .
two goals motivate the approach : ( i ) avoidance of the need for pre-encoded knowledge and ( ii ) applicability across a wide range of text .
we identify a set of lexico-syntactic patterns that are easily recognizable , that occur frequently and across text genre boundaries , and that indisputably indicate the lexical relation of interest .
we describe a method for discovering these patterns and suggest that other lexical relations will also be acquirable in this way .
a subset of the acquisition algorithm is implemented and the results are used to augment and critique the structure of a large hand-built thesaurus .
extensions and applications to areas such as information retrieval are suggested .
