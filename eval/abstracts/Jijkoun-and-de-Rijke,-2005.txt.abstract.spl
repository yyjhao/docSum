we describe our participation in the pascal-2005 recognizing textual entailment challenge .
our method is based on calculating directed sentence similarity : checking the directed semantic word overlap between the text and the hypothesis .
we use frequency-based term weighting in combination with two different lexical similarity measures .
our best run shows 0.55 accuracy on the test data , although the difference between our two runs is not significant .
we found remarkably different optimal threshold values for the development and test data .
we argue that , in addition to accuracy , precision and recall are valuable measures to consider for textual entailment .
