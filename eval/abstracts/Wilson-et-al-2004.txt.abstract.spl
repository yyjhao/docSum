there has been a recent swell of interest in the automatic identification and extraction of opinions and emotions in text .
in this paper , we present the first experimental results classifying the strength of opinions and other types of subjectivity and classifying the subjectivity of deeply nested clauses .
we use a wide range of features , including new syntactic features developed for opinion recognition .
in 10-fold cross validation experiments using support vector regression , we achieve improvements in mean-squared error over baseline ranging from 57 % to 64 % .
