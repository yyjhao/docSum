entity detection and tracking is a relatively new addition to the repertoire of natural language tasks .
in this paper , we present a statistical language-independent framework for identifying and tracking named , nominal and pronominal references to entities within unrestricted text documents , and chaining them into clusters corresponding to each logical entity present in the text .
both the mention detection model and the novel entity tracking model can use arbitrary feature types , being able to integrate a wide array of lexical , syntactic and semantic features .
in addition , the mention detection model crucially uses feature streams derived from different named entity classifiers .
the proposed framework is evaluated with several experiments run in arabic , chinese and english texts ; a system based on the approach described here and submitted to the latest automatic content extraction ( ace ) evaluation achieved top-tier results in all three evaluation languages .
