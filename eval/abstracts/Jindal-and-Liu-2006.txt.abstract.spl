this paper studies a text mining problem , comparative sentence mining .
a comparative sentence expresses an ordering relation between two sets of entities with respect to some common features .
for example , the comparative sentence canons optics are better than those of sony and nikon expresses the comparative relation : ( better , { optics } , { canon } , { sony , nikon } ) .
given a set of evaluative texts on the web , e.g. , reviews , forum postings , and news articles , the task of comparative sentence mining is ( 1 ) to identify comparative sentences from the texts and ( 2 ) to extract comparative relations from the identified comparative sentences .
this problem has many applications .
for example , a product manufacturer wants to know customer opinions of its products in comparison with those of its competitors .
in this paper , we propose two novel techniques based on two new types of sequential rules to perform the tasks .
experimental evaluation has been conducted using different types of evaluative texts from the web .
results show that our techniques are very promising .
