it is challenging to translate names and technical terms across languages with different alphabets and sound inventories .
these items are commonly transliterated , i.e. , replaced with approximate phonetic equivalents .
for example , " computer " in english comes out as " konpyuutaa " in japanese .
translating such items from japanese back to english is even more challenging , and of practical interest , as transliterated items make up the bulk of text phrases not found in bilingual dictionaries .
we describe and evaluate a method for performing backwards transliterations by machine .
this method uses a generative model , incorporating several distinct stages in the transliteration process .
