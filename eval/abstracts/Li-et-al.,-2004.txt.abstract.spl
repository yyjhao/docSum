most foreign names are transliterated into chinese , japanese or korean with approximate phonetic equivalents .
the transliteration is usually achieved through intermediate phonemic mapping .
this paper presents a new framework that allows direct orthographical mapping ( dom ) between two different languages , through a joint source-channel model , also called n-gram transliteration model ( tm ) .
with the n-gram tm model , we automate the orthographic alignment process to derive the aligned transliteration units from a bilingual dictionary .
the n-gram tm under the dom framework greatly reduces system development effort and provides a quantum leap in improvement in transliteration accuracy over that of other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms .
the modeling framework is validated through several experiments for english-chinese language pair .
