entity resolution is a very common information quality ( iq ) problem with many different applications .
in digital libraries , it is related to problems of citation matching and author name disambiguation ; in natural language processing , it is related to coreference matching and object identity ; in web application , it is related to web page disambiguation .
the problem of entity resolution arises because objects / entities in real world datasets are often referred to by descriptions , which might not be unique identifiers of these entities , leading to ambiguity .
the goal is to group all the entity descriptions that refer to the same real world entities .
in this paper we present a graphical approach for entity resolution .
it complements the traditional methodology with the analysis of the entity-relationship graph constructed for the dataset being analyzed .
the paper demonstrates that a technique that measures the degree of interconnectedness between various pairs of nodes in the graph can significantly improve the quality of entity resolution .
furthermore , the paper presents an algorithm for making that technique self-adaptive to the underlying data , thus minimizing the required participation from the domain-analyst and potentially further improving the disambiguation quality .
