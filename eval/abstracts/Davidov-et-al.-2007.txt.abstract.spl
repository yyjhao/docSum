we present a web mining method for discovering and enhancing relationships in which a specified concept ( word class ) participates .
we discover a whole range of relationships focused on the given concept , rather than generic known relationships as in most previous work .
our method is based on clustering patterns that contain concept words and other words related to them .
we evaluate the method on three different rich concepts and find that in each case the method generates a broad variety of relationships with good precision .
