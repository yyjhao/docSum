the web has become an excellent source for gathering consumer opinions .
there are now numerous web sites containing such opinions , e.g. , customer reviews of products , forums , discussion groups , and blogs .
this paper focuses on online customer reviews of products .
it makes two contributions .
first , it proposes a novel framework for analyzing and comparing consumer opinions of competing products .
a prototype system called opinion observer is also implemented .
the system is such that with a single glance of its visualization , the user is able to clearly see the strengths and weaknesses of each product in the minds of consumers in terms of various product features .
this comparison is useful to both potential customers and product manufacturers .
for a potential customer , he / she can see a visual side-by-side and feature-by-feature comparison of consumer opinions on these products , which helps him / her to decide which product to buy .
for a product manufacturer , the comparison enables it to easily gather marketing intelligence and product benchmarking information .
second , a new technique based on language pattern mining is proposed to extract product features from pros and cons in a particular type of reviews .
such features form the basis for the above comparison .
experimental results show that the technique is highly effective and outperform existing methods significantly .
