information extraction systems usually require two dictionaries : a semantic lexicon and a dictionary of extraction patterns for the domain .
we present a multilevel bootstrapping algorithm that generates both the semantic lexicon and extraction patterns simultaneously .
as input , our technique requires only unannotated training texts and a handful of seed words for a category .
we use a mutual bootstrapping technique to alternately select the best extraction pattern for the category and bootstrap its extractions into the semantic lexicon , which is the basis for selecting the next extraction pattern .
to make this approach more robust , we add a second level of bootstrapping ( meta- bootstrapping ) that retains only the most reliable lexicon entries produced by mutual bootstrapping and then restarts the process .
we evaluated this multilevel bootstrapping technique on a collection of corporate web pages and a corpus of terrorism news articles .
the algorithm produced high-quality dictionaries for several semantic categories .
