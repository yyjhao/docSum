unsupervised relation identification is the task of automatically discovering interesting relations between entities in a large text corpora .
relations are identified by clustering the frequently co- occurring pairs of entities in such a way that pairs occurring in similar contexts end up belonging to the same clusters .
in this paper we compare several clustering setups , some of them novel and others already tried .
the setups include feature extraction and selection methods and clustering algorithms .
in order to do the comparison , we develop a clustering evaluation metric , specifically adapted for the relation identification task .
our experiments demonstrate significant superiority of the single- linkage hierarchical clustering with the novel threshold selection technique over the other tested clustering algorithms .
also , the experiments indicate that for successful relation identification it is important to use rich complex features of two kinds : features that test both relation slots together ( relation features ) , and features that test only one slot each ( entity features ) .
we have found that using both kinds of features with the best of the algorithms produces very high-precision results , significantly improving over the previous work .
