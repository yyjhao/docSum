the paper presents a review of 200 references in content-based image retrieval .
the paper starts with discussing the working conditions of content-based retrieval : patterns of use , types of pictures , the role of semantics , and the sensory gap .
subsequent sections discuss computational steps for image retrieval systems .
step one of the review is image processing for retrieval sorted by color , texture , and local geometry .
features for retrieval are discussed next , sorted by : accumulative and global features , salient points , object and shape features , signs , and structural combinations thereof .
similarity of pictures and objects in pictures is reviewed for each of the feature types , in close connection to the types and means of feedback the user of the systems is capable of giving by interaction .
we briefly discuss aspects of system engineering : databases , system architecture , and evaluation .
in the concluding section , we present our view on : the driving force of the field , the heritage from computer vision , the influence on computer vision , the role of similarity and of interaction , the need for databases , the problem of evaluation , and the role of the semantic gap .
