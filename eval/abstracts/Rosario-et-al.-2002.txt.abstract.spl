in many types of technical texts , meaning is embedded in noun compounds .
a language understanding program needs to be able to interpret these in order to ascertain sentence meaning .
we explore the possibility of using an existing lexical hierarchy for the purpose of placing words from a noun compound into categories , and then using this category membership to determine the relation that holds between the nouns .
in this paper we present the results of an analysis of this method on two- word noun compounds from the biomedical domain , obtaining classification accuracy of approximately 90 % .
since lexical hierarchies are not necessarily ideally suited for this task , we also pose the question : how far down the hierarchy must the algorithm descend before all the terms within the subhierarchy behave uniformly with respect to the semantic relation in question ?
we find that the topmost levels of the hierarchy yield an accurate classification , thus providing an economic way of assigning relations to noun compounds .
