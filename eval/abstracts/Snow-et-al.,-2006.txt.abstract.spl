we propose a novel algorithm for inducing semantic taxonomies .
previous algorithms for taxonomy induction have typically focused on independent classifiers for discovering new single relationships based on hand-constructed or automatically discovered textual patterns .
by contrast , our algorithm flexibly incorporates evidence from multiple classifiers over heterogenous relationships to optimize the entire structure of the taxonomy , using knowledge of a words coordinate terms to help in determining its hypernyms , and vice versa .
we apply our algorithm on the problem of sense-disambiguated noun hyponym acquisition , where we combine the predictions of hypernym and coordinate term classifiers with the knowledge in a preexisting semantic taxonomy ( wordnet 2.1 ) .
we add 10 , 000 novel synsets to wordnet 2.1 at 84 % precision , a relative error reduction of 70 % over a nonjoint algorithm using the same component classifiers .
finally , we show that a taxonomy built using our algorithm shows a 23 % relative f-score improvement over wordnet 2.1 on an independent testset of hypernym pairs .
