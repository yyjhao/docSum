this paper introduces a new , unsupervised algorithm for noun phrase coreference resolution .
it differs from existing methods in that it views coreference resolution as a clustering task .
in an evaluation on the muc-6 coreference resolution corpus , the algorithm achieves an f-measure of 53.6 % , placing it firmly between the worst ( 40 % ) and best ( 65 % ) systems in the muc-6 evaluation .
more importantly , the clustering approach outperforms the only muc-6 system to treat coreference resolution as a learning problem .
the clustering algorithm appears to provide a flexible mechanism for coordinating the application of context-independent and context-dependent constraints and preferences for accurate partitioning of noun phrases into coreference equivalence classes .
