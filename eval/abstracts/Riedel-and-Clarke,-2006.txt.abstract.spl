integer linear programming has recently been used for decoding in a number of probabilistic models in order to enforce global constraints .
however , in certain applications , such as non-projective dependency parsing and machine translation , the complete formulation of the decoding problem as an integer linear program renders solving intractable .
we present an approach which solves the problem incrementally , thus we avoid creating intractable integer linear programs .
this approach is applied to dutch dependency parsing and we show how the addition of linguistically motivated constraints can yield a significant improvement over state- of-the-art .
