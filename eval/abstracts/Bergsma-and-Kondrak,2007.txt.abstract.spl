a character-based measure of similarity is an important component of many natural language processing systems , including approaches to transliteration , coreference , word alignment , spelling correction , and the identification of cognates in related vocabularies .
we propose an alignment-based discriminative framework for string similarity .
we gather features from substring pairs consistent with a character-based alignment of the two strings .
this approach achieves exceptional performance ; on nine separate cognate identification experiments using six language pairs , we more than double the precision of traditional orthographic measures like longest common subsequence ratio and dices coefficient .
we also show strong improvements over other recent discriminative and heuristic similarity functions .
