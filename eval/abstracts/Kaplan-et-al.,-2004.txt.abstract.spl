this paper reports some experiments that compare the accuracy and performance of two stochastic parsing systems .
the currently popular collins parser is a shallow parser whose output contains more detailed semantically- relevant information than other such parsers .
the xle parser is a deep-parsing system that couples a lexical functional grammar to a log- linear disambiguation component and provides much richer representations theory .
we measured the accuracy of both systems against a gold standard of the parc 700 dependency bank , and also measured their processing times .
we found the deep-parsing system to be more accurate than the collins parser with only a slight reduction in parsing speed .
