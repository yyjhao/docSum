although vast amounts of textual data are freely available , many nlp algorithms exploit only a minute percentage of it .
in this paper , we study the challenges of working at the terascale .
we present an algorithm , designed for the terascale , for mining is-a relations that achieves similar performance to a state-of-the-art linguistically-rich method .
we focus on the accuracy of these two systems as a function of processing time and corpus size .
