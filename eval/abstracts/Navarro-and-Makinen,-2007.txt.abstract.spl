full-text indexes provide fast substring search over large text collections .
a serious problem of these indexes has traditionally been their space consumption .
a recent trend is to develop indexes that exploit the compressibility of the text , so that their size is a function of the compressed text length .
this concept has evolved into self-indexes , which in addition contain enough information to reproduce any text portion , so they replace the text .
the exciting possibility of an index that takes space close to that of the compressed text , replaces it , and in addition provides fast search over it , has triggered a wealth of activity and produced surprising results in a very short time , which radically changed the status of this area in less than five years .
the most successful indexes nowadays are able to obtain almost optimal space and search time simultaneously .
in this paper we present the main concepts underlying ( compressed ) self-indexes .
we explain the relationship between text entropy and regularities that show up in index structures and permit compressing them .
then we cover the most relevant self-indexes , focusing on how they exploit text compressibility to achieve compact structures that can efficiently solve various search problems .
our aim is to give the background to understand and follow the developments in this area .
