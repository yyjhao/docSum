we propose a novel method for automatically interpreting compound nouns based on a predefined set of semantic relations .
first we map verb tokens in sentential contexts to a fixed set of seed verbs using wordnet : : similarity and moby ï¿½ s thesaurus .
we then match the sentences with semantic relations based on the semantics of the seed verbs and grammatical roles of the head noun and modifier .
based on the semantics of the matched sentences , we then build a classifier using timbl .
the performance of our final system at interpreting ncs is 52.6 % .
