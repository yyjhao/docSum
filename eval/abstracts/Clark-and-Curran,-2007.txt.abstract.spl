a key question facing the parsing community is how to compare parsers which use different grammar formalisms and produce different output .
evaluating a parser on the same resource used to create it can lead to non-comparable accuracy scores and an over-optimistic view of parser performance .
in this paper we evaluate a ccg parser on depbank , and demonstrate the difficulties in converting the parser output into depbank grammatical relations .
in addition we present a method for measuring the effectiveness of the conversion , which provides an upper bound on parsing accuracy .
the ccg parser obtains an f-score of 81.9 % on labelled dependencies , against an upper bound of 84.8 % .
we compare the ccg parser against the rasp parser , outperforming rasp by over 5 % overall and on the majority of dependency types .
