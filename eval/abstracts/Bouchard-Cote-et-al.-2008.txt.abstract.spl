we present a probabilistic approach to language change in which word forms are represented by phoneme sequences that undergo stochastic edits along the branches of a phylogenetic tree .
this framework combines the advantages of the classical comparative method with the robustness of corpus-based probabilistic models .
we use this framework to explore the consequences of two different schemes for defining probabilistic models of phonological change , evaluating these schemes by reconstructing ancient word forms of romance languages .
the result is an efficient inference procedure for automatically inferring ancient word forms from modern languages , which can be generalized to support inferences about linguistic phylogenies .
