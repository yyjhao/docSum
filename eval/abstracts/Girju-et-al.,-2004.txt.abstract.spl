the discovery of semantic relations in text plays an important role in many nlp applications .
this paper presents a method for the automatic classification of semantic relations in nominalized noun phrases .
nominalizations represent a subclass of np constructions in which either the head or the modifier noun is derived from a verb while the other noun is an argument of this verb .
especially designed features are extracted automatically and used in a support vector machine learning model .
the paper presents preliminary results for the semantic classification of the most representative np patterns using four distinct learning models .
