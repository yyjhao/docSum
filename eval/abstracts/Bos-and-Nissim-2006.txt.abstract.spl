in this paper we introduce an empirical approach to the semantic interpretation of superlative adjectives .
we present a corpus annotated for superlatives and propose an interpretation algorithm that uses a wide-coverage parser and produces semantic representations .
we achieve f- scores between 0.84 and 0.91 for detecting attributive superlatives and an accuracy in the range of 0.690.84 for determining the correct comparison set .
as far as we are aware , this is the first automated approach to superlatives for open-domain texts and questions .
