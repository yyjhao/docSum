unsupervised paraphrase acquisition has been an active research field in recent years , but its effective coverage and performance have rarely been evaluated .
we propose a generic paraphrase-based approach for relation extraction ( re ) , aiming at a dual goal : obtaining an applicative evaluation scheme for paraphrase acquisition and obtaining a generic and largely unsupervised configuration for re .
we analyze the potential of our approach and evaluate an implemented prototype of it using an re dataset .
our findings reveal a high potential for unsupervised paraphrase acquisition .
we also identify the need for novel robust models for matching paraphrases in texts , which should address syntactic complexity and variability .
