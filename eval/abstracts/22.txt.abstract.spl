social networks play important roles in the semantic web : knowledge management , information retrieval , ubiquitous computing , and so on .
we propose a social network extraction system called polyphonet , which employs several advanced techniques to extract relations of persons , detect groups of persons , and obtain keywords for a person .
search engines , especially google , are used to measure co-occurrence of information and obtain web documents .
several studies have used search engines to extract social networks from the web , but our research advances the following points : first , we reduce the related methods into simple pseudocodes using google so that we can build up integrated systems .
second , we develop several new algorithms for social networking mining such as those to classify relations into categories , to make extraction scalable , and to obtain and utilize person-to-word relations .
third , every module is implemented in polyphonet , which has been used at four academic conferences , each with more than 500 participants .
we overview that system .
finally , a novel architecture called super social network mining is proposed ; it utilizes simple modules using google and is characterized by scalability and relate-identify processes : identification of each entity and extraction of relations are repeated to obtain a more precise social network .
