we present an unsupervised learning algorithm that mines large text corpora for patterns that express implicit semantic relations .
for a given input word pair x : y with some unspecified semantic relations , the corresponding output list of patterns p1 , ... , pm is ranked according to how well each pattern pi expresses the relations between x and y. for example , given x = ostrich and y = bird , the two highest ranking output patterns are x is the largest y and y such as the x. the output patterns are intended to be useful for finding further pairs with the same relations , to support the construction of lexicons , ontologies , and semantic networks .
the patterns are sorted by pertinence , where the pertinence of a pattern pi for a word pair x : y is the expected relational similarity between the given pair and typical pairs for pi .
the algorithm is empirically evaluated on two tasks , solving multiple-choice sat word analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs .
on both tasks , the algorithm achieves state- of-the-art results , performing significantly better than several alternative pattern ranking algorithms , based on tf-idf .
