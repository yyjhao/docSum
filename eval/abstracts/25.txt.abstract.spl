finding information about people on the web using a search engine is difficult because there is a many-to-many mapping between person names and specific persons ( i.e. referents ) .
this paper describes a person resolution system , called webhawk .
given a list of pages obtained by submitting a person query to a search engine , webhawk facilitates person search in three steps : first of all , a filter removes those pages that contain no information about any person .
secondly , a cluster groups the remaining pages into different clusters , each for one specific person .
to make the resulting clusters more meaningful , an extractor is used to induce query-oriented personal information from each page .
finally , a namer generates an informative description for each cluster so that users can find any specific person easily .
the architecture of webhawk is presented , and the four components are discussed in detail , with a separate evaluation of each component presented where appropriate .
a user study shows that webhawk complements most existing search engines and successfully improves users experience of person search on the web .
