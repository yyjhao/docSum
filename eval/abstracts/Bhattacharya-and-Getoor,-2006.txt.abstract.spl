entity resolution has received considerable attention in recent years .
given many references to underlying entities , the goal is to predict which references correspond to the same entity .
we show how to extend the latent dirichlet allocation model for this task and propose a probabilistic model for collective entity resolution for relational domains where references are connected to each other .
our approach differs from other recently proposed entity resolution approaches in that it is a ) generative , b ) does not make pair-wise decisions and c ) captures relations between entities through a hidden group variable .
we propose a novel sampling algorithm for collective entity resolution which is unsupervised and also takes entity relations into account .
additionally , we do not assume the domain of entities to be known and show how to infer the number of entities from the data .
we demonstrate the utility and practicality of our relational entity resolution approach for author resolution in two real-world bibliographic datasets .
in addition , we present preliminary results on characterizing conditions under which relational information is useful .
