in many applications , it is necessary to determine the similarity of two strings .
a widely-used notion of string similarity is the edit distance : the minimum number of insertions , deletions , and substitutions required to transform one string into the other .
in this report , we provide a stochastic model for string-edit distance .
our stochastic model allows us to learn a string-edit distance function from a corpus of examples .
we illustrate the utility of our approach by applying it to the difficult problem of learning the pronunciation of words in conversational speech .
in this application , we learn a string-edit distance with nearly one-fifth the error rate of the untrained levenshtein distance .
our approach is applicable to any string classification problem that may be solved using a similarity function against a database of labeled prototypes .
