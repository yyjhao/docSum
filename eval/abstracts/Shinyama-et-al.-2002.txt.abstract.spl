paraphrases play an important role in the variety and complexity of natural language documents .
however they adds to the difficulty of natural language processing .
here we describe a procedure for obtaining paraphrases from news article .
a set of paraphrases can be useful for various kinds of applications .
articles derived from different newspapers can contain paraphrases if they report the same event of the same day .
we exploit this feature by using named entity recognition .
our basic approach is based on the assumption that named entities are preserved across paraphrases .
we applied our method to articles of two domains and obtained notable examples .
although this is our initial attempt to automatically extracting paraphrases from a corpus , the results are promising .
