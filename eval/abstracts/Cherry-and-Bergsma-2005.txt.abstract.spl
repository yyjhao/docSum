we propose an unsupervised expectation maximization approach to pronoun resolution .
the system learns from a fixed list of potential antecedents for each pronoun .
we show that unsupervised learning is possible in this context , as the performance of our system is comparable to supervised methods .
our results indicate that a probabilistic gender / number model , determined automatically from unlabeled text , is a powerful feature for this task .
