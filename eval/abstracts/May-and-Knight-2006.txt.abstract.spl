ranked lists of output trees from syntactic statistical nlp applications frequently contain multiple repeated entries .
this redundancy leads to misrepresentation of tree weight and reduced information for debugging and tuning purposes .
it is chiefly due to nondeterminism in the weighted automata that produce the results .
we introduce an algorithm that determinizes such automata while preserving proper weights , returning the sum of the weight of all multiply derived trees .
we also demonstrate our algorithm ï¿½ s effectiveness on two large-scale tasks .
