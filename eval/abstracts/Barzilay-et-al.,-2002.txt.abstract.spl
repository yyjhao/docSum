the problem of organizing information for multidocument summarization so that the generated summary is coherent has received relatively little attention .
while sentence ordering for single document summarization can be determined from the ordering of sentences in the input article , this is not the case for multidocument summarization where summary sentences may be drawn from different input articles .
in this paper , we propose a methodology for studying the properties of ordering information in the news genre and describe experiments done on a corpus of multiple acceptable orderings we developed for the task .
based on these experiments , we implemented a strategy for ordering information that combines constraints from chronological order of events and topical relatedness .
evaluation of our augmented algorithm shows a significant improvement of the ordering over two baseline strategies .
