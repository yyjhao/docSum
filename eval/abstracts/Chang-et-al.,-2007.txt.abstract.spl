over the last few years , two of the main research directions in machine learning of natural language processing have been the study of semi-supervised learning algorithms as a way to train classifiers when the labeled data is scarce , and the study of ways to exploit knowledge and global information in structured learning tasks .
in this paper , we suggest a method for incorporating domain knowledge in semi-supervised learning algorithms .
our novel framework unifies and can exploit several kinds of task specific constraints .
the experimental results presented in the information extraction domain demonstrate that applying constraints helps the model to generate better feedback during learning , and hence the framework allows for high performance learning with significantly less training data than was possible before on these tasks .
