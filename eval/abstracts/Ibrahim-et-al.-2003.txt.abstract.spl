we present an approach for automatically learning paraphrases from aligned monolingual corpora .
our algorithm works by generalizing the syntactic paths between corresponding anchors in aligned sentence pairs .
compared to previous work , structural paraphrases generated by our algorithm tend to be much longer on average , and are capable of capturing long-distance dependencies .
in addition to a standalone evaluation of our paraphrases , we also describe a question answering application currently under development that could immensely benefit from automatically-learned structural paraphrases .
