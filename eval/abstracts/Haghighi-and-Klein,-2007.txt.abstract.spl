we present an unsupervised , nonparametric bayesian approach to coreference resolution which models both global entity identity across a corpus as well as the sequential anaphoric structure within each document .
while most existing coreference work is driven by pairwise decisions , our model is fully generative , producing each mention from a combination of global entity properties and local attentional state .
despite being unsupervised , our system achieves a 70.3 muc f1 measure on the muc-6 test set , broadly in the range of some recent supervised results .
