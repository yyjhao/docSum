say you are looking for information about a particular person .
a search engine returns many pages for that persons name but which pages are about the person you care about , and which are about other people who happen to have the same name ?
furthermore , if we are looking for multiple people who are related in some way , how can we best leverage this social network ?
this paper presents two unsupervised frameworks for solving this problem : one based on link structure of the web pages , another using agglomerative / conglomerative double clustering ( a / cdc ) an application of a recently introduced multi-way distributional clustering method .
to evaluate our methods , we collected and hand-labeled a dataset of over 1000 web pages retrieved from google queries on 12 personal names appearing together in someones in an email folder .
on this dataset our methods outperform traditional agglomerative clustering by more than 20 % , achieving over 80 % f-measure .
