# Introduction


# Formulation

## Assumptions

We start the formulation with the following assumptions:

1. Articles consist of ideas
1. Ideas flow
1. Each sentence presents some ideas
1. Ideas are expressed through words
1. Overlap of words signifies relation of ideas

We can then assume that a sentence is significant, thus _summarizing_, if
ideas from many other sentences flow to it.

We further assume that by assembling a set of _summarizing_ sentences, we
can produce a good summary. Further, to shorten the length of the summary,
we should try to minimize overlaps among sentences in this set.

## Construction of graph

To make use of the assumptions, we formulate the article as a graph of
sentences.

Formally, we can build a graph $\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the
set of sentences.
